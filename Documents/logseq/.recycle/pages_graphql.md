- > REST is an architectural style. GraphQL is a data query language + framework
- # Overview
	- With GraphQL, clients can obtain all of the data they need in one request.
	- Whenever a query is executed against a GraphQL server, it is validated against a type system. A type system is like a blueprint for your API’s data, backed by a list of objects that you define.
	- ```graphql
	  type Person {
	    id: ID!
	    name: String
	    birthYear: String
	    eyeColor: String
	    gender: String
	  }
	  ```
	- GraphQL is often referred to as a **declarative data-fetching language**. Developers list their data requirements as what data they need without focusing on how they’re going to get it.
	- GraphQL is a specification (spec) for client-server communication.
	- A GraphQL query is _hierarchical_. Fields are nested within other fields and the query is shaped like the data that it returns.
	- ## REST Drawbacks
		- **Data overfetching and underfetching** - REST either returns more data than what user needs or would require additional requests are needed to get more details. similar to N+1 problem in ORM
		  * **Too many endpoints** - as the client needs change, more endpoints need to be created which eventually multiply quickly. GraphQL architecture typically involves only a single endpoint.
		- e.g., https://swapi.co/api/people/1/
		  
		  ```json
		  "films": [
		    "https://swapi.co/api/films/2/",
		    "https://swapi.co/api/films/6/",
		    "https://swapi.co/api/films/3/",
		    "https://swapi.co/api/films/1/",
		    "https://swapi.co/api/films/7/"
		  ]
		  ```
- # Query Language
  collapsed:: true
	- Like SQL, GraphQL can be used for all CRUD operations
	- Data Types/Operations:
		- `Query` - read
		- `Mutation` - insert, update and delete
		- `Subscription` - used to listen for data changes
	- A GraphQL document can contain the definitions of one or more operations. For example, one could place 2 query operations in a query document.
	- A JSON response can contain both “data” and “errors.”
	- ## Query
	  collapsed:: true
		- A `Query` data type is called a _root type_ because it’s a type that maps to an operation, and operations represent the roots of our query document.
		- **Selection sets**
			- When we write queries, we are selecting the fields that we need by encapsulating them in curly brackets. These blocks are referred to as selection sets.
			- You can nest selection sets within one another.
		- **Fields**
			- The _fields_ that are available to query in a GraphQL API have been defined in that API’s schema. The documentation will tell us what fields are available to select on the Query type.
			- fields can be either scalar types or object types.
		- **Response**
			- We can change the field names in the response object within the query by specifying an _alias_. e.g., `liftName` in below example.
		- **Query Arguments**
			- A way to filter the results of a GraphQL query is to pass in _query arguments_.
			- Arguments are a key–value pair (or pairs) associated with a query field.
				- ```
				  query liftsAndTrails {
				    open: liftCount(status: OPEN, sortBy: "name")
				    chairlifts: allLifts {
				      liftName: name
				      status
				    }
				    skiSlopes: allTrails {
				      name
				      difficulty
				    }
				  }
				  ```
				- ```json
				  {
				  "data": {
				    "open": 5,
				    "chairlifts": [
				      {
				        "liftName": "Astra Express",
				        "status": "open"
				      }
				    ],
				    "skiSlopes": [
				      {
				        "name": "Ditch of Doom",
				        "difficulty": "intermediate"
				      }
				    ]
				  }
				  }
				  ```
				- Example for passing a GraphQL query in curl: 
				  
				  ```bash
				  curl  'http://snowtooth.herokuapp.com/'
				  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
				  --data '{"query":"{ allLifts {name }}"}'`
				  ```
		- ### Object types
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```
			  type User {
			    name: String!
			    username: String!
			  }
			  
			  type Document {
			    title: String!
			    content: String!
			    author: User!
			  }
			  ```
		- ### One-to-Many connections
		  collapsed:: true
			- A one-to-many relationship between `User` and `Document`. Notice that the documents field will contain an actual array of documents.
			- ```
			  type User {
			    name: String!
			    username: String!
			    email: String!
			    noOfDocuments: Int!
			    documents: [Document!]!
			  }
			  ```
			- In this example, `trailAccess` returns a filtered list of trails that are accessible from _Jazz Cat_. Because `trailAccess` is a field within the `Lift` type, the API can use details about the parent object, the Jazz Cat `Lift`, to filter the list of returned trails.
				- ```
				  query trailsAccessedByJazzCat {
				    Lift(id:"jazz-cat") {
				        capacity
				        trailAccess {
				            name
				            difficulty
				        }
				    }
				  }
				  ```
		- ### Fragments
		  collapsed:: true
			- Resuable set of fields to include in queries.
			- ```
			  {
			    leftComparison: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
			      ...comparisonFields # JS spread operator
			    }
			    rightComparison: hero(episode: JEDI) {
			      ...comparisonFields
			    }
			  }
			  
			  fragment comparisonFields on Character {
			    name
			    appearsIn
			    friends {
			      name
			    }
			  }
			  ```
		- ### Union types
		  collapsed:: true
			- If you want a list to return more than one type, you could create a _union type_, which creates an association between two different object types.
			- Suppose that we’re building a scheduling app for college students with which they can add Workout and Study Group events to an agenda. When writing a query for a student’s agenda, you can use fragments to define which fields to select when the `AgendaItem` is a `Workout`, and which fields to select when the `AgendaItem` is a `StudyGroup`.
			- ```
			  query schedule {
			    agenda {
			    ...on Workout { # inline fragments
			      name
			      reps
			    }
			    ...on StudyGroup {
			      name
			      subject
			      students
			    }
			  }
			  }
			  ```
			- ```json
			  {
			  "data": {
			    "agenda": [
			      {
			        "name": "Comp Sci",
			        "subject": "Computer Science",
			        "students": 12
			      },
			      {
			        "name": "Cardio",
			        "reps": 100
			      },
			      {
			        "name": "Poets",
			        "subject": "English 101",
			        "students": 3
			      }
			    ]
			  }
			  }
			  ```
			- The same union type above using named fragments
				- ```
				  query today {
				    agenda {
				      ...workout
				      ...study
				    }
				  }
				  
				  fragment workout on Workout {
				    name
				    reps
				  }
				  
				  fragment study on StudyGroup {
				    name
				    subject
				    students
				  }
				  ```
		- ### Interfaces
		  collapsed:: true
			- Interfaces are another option when dealing with multiple object types that could be returned by a single field. An interface is an abstract type that establishes a list of fields that should be implemented in similar object types. When another type implements the interface, it includes all of the fields from the interface and usually some of its own fields.
			- ```
			  interface Character {
			  id: ID!
			  name: String!
			  friends: [Character]
			  appearsIn: [Episode]!
			  }
			  
			  type Human implements Character {
			  id: ID!
			  name: String!
			  friends: [Character]
			  appearsIn: [Episode]!
			  starships: [Starship]
			  totalCredits: Int
			  }
			  
			  type Droid implements Character {
			  id: ID!
			  name: String!
			  friends: [Character]
			  appearsIn: [Episode]!
			  primaryFunction: String
			  }
			  ```
	- ## Mutation
	  collapsed:: true
		- `Mutation` is a root object type
		- In the below example, it returns a selection set with `name` and `status` after mutation
		- ```
		  mutation {
		    setLiftStatus(id: "panorama" status: OPEN) {
		      name
		      status
		    }
		  }
		  ```
		- Using query variables to replace hardcoded values in the mutation arguments
		- ```
		  mutation createSong($title:String! $numberOne:Int $by:String!) {
		    addSong(title:$title, numberOne:$numberOne, performerName:$by) {
		      id
		      title
		      numberOne
		    }
		  }
		  ```
	- ## Introspection
	  collapsed:: true
		- Introspection is the ability to query details about the current API's schema. You can send queries to every GraphQL API that return data about a given API’s schema.
		- This query returns all available types in the API, including root types, custom types, and even scalar types.
		- ```
		  query {
		    __schema {
		      types {
		        name
		        description
		      }
		    }
		  }
		  ```
		- To see the details of a particular type, we can run the `__type` query and send the name of the type that we want to query as an argument:
			- ```
			  query liftDetails {
			    __type(name:"Lift") {
			      name
			      fields {
			        name
			        description
			        type {
			  	      name
			        }
			      }
			    }
			  }
			  ```
- # Schema Design
  collapsed:: true
	- GraphQL is going to change your design process. Instead of looking at APIs as a collection of REST endpoints, begin looking at your APIs as collections of types.
	- __Schema First Design__
		- _Schema First_ design methodology gets all teams on the same page about the data types that make up your application.
		- The backend team will have a clear understanding about the data that it needs to store and deliver. The frontend team will have the definitions that it needs to begin building user interfaces.
	- GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) is same irrespective of the language or framework in which your application is built.
	- __Schema & Types__
		- A _schema_ is a collection of type definitions. You can write your schemas in a JS file as a string or in any text file. These files usually carry the `.graphql` extension.
		- A _type_ has fields that represent the data associated with each object. Each field returns a specific type of data. This could mean an integer or a string, but it also could mean a custom object type or list of types.
		- The exclamation point specifies that the field is non-nullable, which means that the name and url fields must return some data in each query
		- ```json
		  """
		  Defining a custom type named Photo
		  """
		  type Photo {
		    id: ID!
		    name: String!
		    url: String!
		  
		    "Optional field to describe the photo
		    "
		    description: String
		  }
		  ```
	- ## Scalar types
	  collapsed:: true
		- A scalar type is not an object type. It does not have fields.
		- Built-in scalar types
		- `Int`, `Float` - return JSON numbers
		- `String`, `ID` (unique identifiers) - return strings.
			- Even though ID and String will return the same type of JSON data, GraphQL still makes sure that IDs return unique strings
			- the ID scalar type is used when a unique identifier should be returned.
		- `Boolean` - return boolean
		- Custom scalar type
		- In the example below, a custom scalar type: `DateTime` is created.
		- Any field marked `DateTime` will return a JSON string, but we can use the custom scalar to make sure that string can be serialized, validated, and formatted as an official date and time
		- The `graphql-custom-types` npm package contains some commonly used custom scalar types
		- _enums_ are scalar types that allow a field to return a restrictive set of string values.
		- ```
		  scalar DateTime
		  
		  enum PhotoCategory {
		    PORTRAIT
		    LANDSCAPE
		  }
		  
		  type Photo {
		    id: ID!
		    name: String!
		    url: String!
		    description: String
		    created: DateTime!
		    category: PhotoCategory!
		  }
		  ```
	- ## Object Types
	  collapsed:: true
		- GraphQL object types are user-defined groups of one or more fields that you define in your schema. They define the shape of the JSON object that should be returned. JSON can endlessly nest objects under fields, and so can GraphQL
	- ## Connections and Lists
	  collapsed:: true
		- When you create GraphQL schemas, you can define fields that return lists of any GraphQL type
		- A list can contain elements of different types
		- Variations
		- `[Int]` - A list of nullable integer values
		- `[Int!]` - A list of non-nullable integer values
		- `[Int]!` - A non-nullable list of nullable integer values
		- `[Int!]!` - A non-nullable list of non-nullable integer values
		- One-to-many connections
		- It is a good idea to keep GraphQL services undirected when possible. This provides our clients with the ultimate flexibility to create queries because they can start traversing the graph from any node. All we need to do to follow this practice is provide a path back from `User` types to `Photo` types. This means that when we query a `User`, we should get to see all of the photos that particular user posted:
		- ```
		  type User {
		    githubLogin: ID!
		    name: String
		    avatar: String
		    postedPhotos: [Photo!]!
		  }
		  
		  type Photo {
		    id: ID!
		    name: String!
		    url: String!
		    description: String
		    created: DateTime!
		    category: PhotoCategory!
		    postedBy: User!
		  }
		  ```
		- ### Many-to-many connections
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```
			  type User {
			    ...
			    inPhotos: [Photo!]!
			  }
			  
			  type Photo {
			    ...
			    taggedUsers: [User!]!
			  }
			  ```
		- ### Unions
		  collapsed:: true
			- a union type is a type that we can use to return one of several different types.
			- `AgendaItem` combines study groups and workouts under a single type. When we add the agenda field to our Query, we are defining it as a list of either workouts or study groups.
			- ```
			  union AgendaItem = StudyGroup | Workout
			  
			  type StudyGroup {
			    name: String!
			    subject: String
			    students: [User!]!
			  }
			  
			  type Workout {
			    name: String!
			    reps: Int!
			  }
			  
			  type Query {
			    agenda: [AgendaItem!]!
			  }
			  ```
		- ### Interfaces
		  collapsed:: true
			- Another way of handling fields that could contain multiple types is to use an interface.
			- Both union types and interfaces are tools that you can use to create fields that contain different object types.
			- In general, if the objects contain completely different fields, it is a good idea to use union types. They are very effective. If an object type must contain specific fields in order to interface with another type of object, you will need to use an interface rather than a union type.
			- ```
			  scalar DateTime
			  
			  interface AgendaItem {
			    name: String!
			    start: DateTime!
			    end: DateTime!
			  }
			  
			  type StudyGroup implements AgendaItem {
			    name: String!
			    start: DateTime!
			    end: DateTime!
			    participants: [User!]!
			    topic: String!
			  }
			  
			  type Workout implements AgendaItem {
			    name: String!
			    start: DateTime!
			    end: DateTime!
			    reps: Int!
			  }
			  
			  type Query {
			    agenda: [AgendaItem!]!
			  }
			  ```
	- ## Arguments
	  collapsed:: true
		- Arguments can be added to any field in GraphQL.
		- Just like a field, an argument must have a type - which can be scalar types or object types that are available in our schema.
		- ```
		  type Query {
		    ...
		    User(githubLogin: ID!): User! # mandatory argument
		    Photo(category: PhotoCategory): [Photo!]! # optional argument
		  }
		  ```
	- ## Data Paging
	  collapsed:: true
		- Used to control the number of records returned in query response
		- ```
		  type Query {
		    ...
		    allUsers(first: Int=50 start: Int=0): [User!]!
		    allPhotos(first: Int=25 start: Int=0): [Photo!]!
		  }
		  ```
	- ## Sorting
	  collapsed:: true
		- ```
		  enum SortDirection {
		    ASCENDING
		    DESCENDING
		  }
		  
		  enum SortablePhotoField {
		    name
		    description
		    category
		    created
		  }
		  
		  Query {
		    allPhotos(
		        sort: SortDirection = DESCENDING
		        sortBy: SortablePhotoField = created
		    ): [Photo!]!
		  }
		  ```
	- ## Return Types
	  collapsed:: true
		- ```
		  type AuthPayload {
		    user: User!
		    token: String!
		  }
		  
		  type Mutation {
		    ...
		    githubAuth(code: String!): AuthPayload!
		  }
		  ```
