- - What is a Knowledge Graph?
      - In Logic Programming, KG is logically consistent collection of facts
      - > Data Integration + Concepts AND Relationships are first class citizens = Linked Data and Metadata encoded in a Graph
      *Ontology + Instance Data = Knowledge Graph
  - Glossary
      - Taxonomy
          - Taxonomy is hierarchical
          - Multi-lingual taxonomy is used for searching data in English within documents that are in non-English 
      - Ontology
  
  - What is in a Knowledge Graph?
      - A semantic graph database (scalable, secure, acid) 
      - Ontologies and taxonomies
      - Reasoning and rule based processing
      - Smart integration of silos of information
      - Machine Learning and Advanced Analytics
      - Natural Language Processing and Text classification
  - Types of KG
      - Document/text based KG
      - Entity/Event bsaed KG
  - Representations of KG
      - Symbolic representation - `s,p,o` (triplet), `p (s,o)`, `(s,p,o)`
          - `s` = subject, `p` = predicate, `o` = object
          - used in logical inference systems, DB and DB integration systems
      - Vector representation - `s,p,o ε `
          - used in NLP
  - Methodologies
      - Creata Data/Execute Queries
          - there are 2 approaches: Materialization (ETL) and Virtualization (No ETL)
          - __Materialization__: Create an ETL job to extract the source data from RDBMS, apply the mapping defined, then transform and load it to a graph DB.
          - __Virtualization__: Take SPARQL queries as input, apply the mapping logic and convert it into a SQL to extract the data. The results are then stored in a graph DB.
  - Tools
      - Data modelling: RDF, RDFS, OWL?
      - Query language: SPARQL
      - Ontologies
