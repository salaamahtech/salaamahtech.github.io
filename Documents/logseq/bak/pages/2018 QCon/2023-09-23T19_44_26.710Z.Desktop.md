	    * https://medium.com/@cfatechblog
	    * Problem: Driving food production via IoT, automating some of the cooking devices, sales data, payment processing, etc
	    * Edge computing - every restaurant runs a Kubernetes cluster
	    * Why edge - because every restaurant should continue to operate even in absence of network failure or other disasters
	    * 2000 restaurants - 2000 clusters, 6000 nodes, 7 engineers including an SRE run the infra
	    * Restaurant data center - NUC device = Intel quadcore processor, 8GB RAM
	    * manageable remotely, automated device discovery and self-clustering, self-healing
	    * Friers and other devices are controlled by this device
	    * prometheus runs on the edge
	    * Components
	        * Highlander - custom tool for clustering leader election
	        * Istio - alternate to NGinx
	        * cluster initialization
	            * used RKE(Rancher Kubernetes Engine)
	            * other options tried: kops ( no bare metal), kubespray (slow, brittle), kubeadm (may be in future), RKE
	        * Resetting cluster state:
	            * need to be able to re-image remotely
	            * solution: Overlay FS + HAMS (manages wiping clsuters and restoring to base)
	        * [Hooves up](https://github.com/chick-fil-a/hoovesup) - self healing AWS SSM (Simple systems manager) registration - able to do remote commands and patch reporting/management - remotely logging via SSM and issue AWS commands to install Ansible

	  * Canopy: Scalable Distributed Tracing & Analysis @Facebook
	    * Observability
	    * how distributed tracing works in microservices world - [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/documentation/)
	    * what is p75 and p90 in terms of latency
	    * Distributed Tracing - holistic view of a single request - each request is assigned a token - tracing happens at transport level, not application level - each writes to a common store - don't trace all requests, use sampling say one out of every 100 or 1000 requests
	    * multithreaded service calls
	    * Does NewRelic support distrubted tracing?
	    * [canopy-end-to-end-performance-tracing-at-scale](https://research.fb.com/publications/canopy-end-to-end-performance-tracing-at-scale/)

	        * 
	  
	  * Scaling Push Messaging for Millions of Devices @Netflix
	    * PUSH - persist until something happens
	    * Zuul - uses WebSockets/SSE
	    * used to push real-time update of movie suggestions - helped reduce 12% of load on Netflix servers
	    * what is C10K challenge - 10K concurrent connections at a time to a server - creating a new thread for each socket connection doesn't scale - Async I/O uses read/write callback and single thread
	    * Netflix uses Netty non-blocking I/O
	    * Zuul push server
	        * clients connect to these servers which opens a websocket connection
	        * connections are auto-closed periodically on the server to avoid clients connecting to old version of software/cluster after a server upgrade (avoiding thundering herd problem) - randomize each connection lifetime ( to avoid recurring thundering herd problem caused by any blips) - ask client to close connection within a time frame
	        * how to optimize push servers - Goldilocks strategy - more smaller instances, not fewer large instances
	        * how to auto-scale - based on open connections per server
	        * Amazon ELBs cannot proxy websockets - by default they run as HTTP load balancer - run ELB as a TCP load balancer to solve the problem. Amazon now supports ALB (websocket-aware application load balancer) supports web sockets
	    * Zuul push registry 
	        * keeps track of which client is connected to which push server 
	        * any data store with with following features can be used as push registry. Netflix uses Dynomite
	            * low read latency
	            * record expiry (when client disconnects) 
	            * sharding and replication
	    * Message Processing
	        * uses kafka
	        * application uses push library to push the message to a queue
	        * multiple - uses Mantis (similar to Flink) to streamline process the queues
	  
	  * Forced Evolution: Shopify's Journey to Kubernetes
	    * 
	  * 3 Common Pitfalls in Microservice Integration
	    * Google for InfoWorld article on the same topic by the presenter
	    * Challenges of Asynchronicity
	        * synchronous blocking call exhausts threads in pool - use circuit breaker (Netflix Hystrix) 
	        * fail fast is important but not enough - (e.g., flight check-in failure due to bar code generator)
	        * Workflow engines, state machines - AWS Step Functions, Uber Cadence, Netflix Conductor, jBPM, Camunda (Java based), Zeebe by Camunda, Activiti
	        * Manigfold architecture options to run a workflow engine - blog article
	        * A synchronous response is possible in the happy case, otherwise it is switched to async processing
	    * Communication is complex
	        * Client has to implement timeout, retry, compensation
	        * Service Providers has to implement idempotency - (anti-pattern: Do not refresh the page)
	        * It is hard to differentiate communication problems - unable to communicate to service or service received request but unable to respond back
	        * Problems operating message bus - dead message, no context, inaccesible payload, hard to redeliver, ...
	    * Distributed Transactions
	        * Paper: Life beyond distributed transactions: an apostate's opinion - Pet Helland
	        * [Saga pattern](http://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)
	            * or compensating activity (BPMN engine can do that automatically) - Distributed transactions using compensation - eventual consistency
	        * Service Provider has to offer compensation

- ## Day 2
  
  * Keynote - A brief, opinionated history of the API by Joshua Bloch
  * Efficient Fault Tolerant Java with Aeron Clustering
    * Fault Tolerance
        * Load balancer is another form of fault tolerance
        * Fault tolerance of state - partition, replication
        * Guaranteed messaging / queueing don't store the previous state of a system
            * Exactly-Once vs. atleast-once
            * blocking ACK spiral
            * nondeterministic restarts
            * Contention and coherence
            * poison message and error queues
        * Better way: Contiguous log with snapshot & replay
            * processing the log, build a state
            * Aircrafts and spacecrafts process log, build state, marking the snapshot and store the state at that snapshot. In case of failure, it restarts from the last snapshot/checkpoint and starts from the stored state. Same concept as in database checkpoints
        * Clustered services
        * Replicated state machines
            * Raft consensus
                * Strong leader - elected member of the cluster, orders input, disseminates consensus
                * Raft is an algorithm with formal verification
                * Raft is not a specification or a complete system
            * in real-world, we need more than raft
                * leader timestamps events
                * async, not rpc-based
                * timers
            * Benefits
                * determinism
                * log is immutable
                * log can beplayed, stopped and replayed
                * each event is timestamped
                * services are restrated from snapshot and log
            * Distributed key/value store, distributed timers, distributed locks
        * Finance: matching engines, order management, P&L, risk
        * CQRS is another system built on the idea of event logs

    * Shift to Observability
        * Application monitoring - 
        * Application observability (like operations to devops)
            * debugging needs more context
        * Accelerate release lifecycle
    * Overops captures all swallowed exceptions, including the threadstack and data flowing through the code, also provides the author the code causing the error - tells you if the error is new or resurfaced
    * Overops gives app metrics like bugs introduced, swallowed exceptions, etc. release over release - helps towards code accountability
  * Debugging Microservices: How Google SREs Resolve Outages (Google)
    * SLO (Service level objective) - Google has only regional SLOs
        * e.g., Percentage of slow user queries too high

        * [Blockchain Scalability](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/blockchain-scalability/)
    * Solution
        * sending lot of data to lot of people is a solved problem - Akamai '96
        * Relay networks (1 block in bitcoin takes a 10 secs to reach the entire n/w)
            * cons - censorship, discrimination (one miner can restrict blocks from a particular person), ban wallets, requires everyone's trust 
    * bloXroute design

        * prevention 
            * think of SREs and ops as fire fighters - as last resort
            * `#hugops`
            * making it harder for the fire to start
            * wiring inspection (good test suite, chaos engineering)
        * detection
            * stop while it is small
            * use of canary env to test out the impact
            * feature flags to restrict the impact
            * sprinklers - automatic replacement of bad instances or servers instead of 3 am call
        * isolation - preventing it from spreading
            * fire barriers - sharding/replication to isolate the problem
            * fire drills - train on incident response
            * avoiding encumbrances - pay technical debt, tired people make mistakes
        * response
            * controlled burns - controlled outages
    * DO NOT add fire escapes (reliability) as an after-thought to the buildings (software)
    * Bad softwares also could kill people - so the stakes are high
  * Translytical Databases & the New Data-Driven Apps (SAP)
    * SAP HANA platform - multi-modal, in-memory data processing environment
    * Using SQL to query the same data which would typically live in 2 diff db - OLTP and OLAP

    * SLO (Service level objective)
    * Characteristics of a resilient system
        * blameless postmortems - focus on improvement to the process
        * Nature of Work
            * Toiling without any value makes no sense
            * resiliency is a long game, it won't happen overnight - you cannot burn out people
        * Interfaces
            * Error budget - developers and SRE meeting constantly to discuss the state of the code and system. There is no point in blaming each other about quality of code and instability of the system
