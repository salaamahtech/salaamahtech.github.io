	- ## VI Tips
		- > Note: Anything between [ and ] denotes a command executed from within vi.
		-  `[ !wc % ]` - opens a command shell and runs 'wc' on the current file open in vi. `%` means current file & `!` is called 'Bang'. Bang works best with non-interactive commands
		-  `[ qa ]` close all files open
		-  `[ ga ]` Show character info
		-  `[ ls ]` List buffers
		-  `[ % ]` Bracket matching
