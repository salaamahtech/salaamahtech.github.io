## Abstraction
	- hides internal implementation level details and exposes only the relevant details of the class to the users..
- ## Encapsulation
	- combines data (fields) and logically-related operations (methods). Abstraction is achieved through encapsulation.
- ## Inheritance
	- Overriding
- ## Polymorphism
	- is the characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts - specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form. There are several different kinds of polymorphism.
	- Compile-time polymorphism - The call for the same method behaves differently based on the provided arguments.
		- Function Overloading - methods with the same name but with different numbers of arguments or types of arguments.
		- Operator Overloading -same operator having different meanings in different context(eg. +)
	- Runtime polymorphism
		- Overriding
