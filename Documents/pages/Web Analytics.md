# Concepts
	- __What is a Web Tag?__
		- A web tag is a `1x1` pixel-sized image beacon or JavaScript snippet that is embedded into the code of a web page to capture and report data. A web tag is triggered whenever a predetermined action occurs on a specified platform in the web. It captures the data and sends the information back to your preferred data collection system.
		- A web tag is usually implemented to: track online user behavior for marketing analytics, instruct web browsers and implemented technologies to collect data, to set cookies and to integrate third-party content.
- # Web Analytics 1.0
	- Web analytics evolution
		- Web server logs parsing -> WebTrends
		- Javascript Tags
		- Site overlay or Click Density
			- display where visitors clicked
			- segments based on where users came from
	- __Traditional Analytics KPI Metrics__
		- Page views
			- frustrating navigation means more page view, but no buy
			- better naviation means faster decision, and yet no buy
		- Hits
			- Pages with images & media has more hits to the server
			- With CDNs, servers receive lesser hits
			- `more hits != more visitors`
		- Top Exit Pages
			- Top Exit Pages does not mean pages are suboptimal or product is bad
			- Exit rates doesn't tell content is good or bad
		- Website Engagement
			- `Engagement = # of sessions / # of visitors`
			- Repeated visitors means they can't find what they want or the site is good?
		- Visitor screen resolution
			- Seldom this data changes. Instead of wasting time and money capturing this, use Forrestor Research/Gartner data
	- Traditional KPI can't accommodate for strategic business goals. We now have __KIA__ (_Key Insight Analysis_)
	- __KIA__ (_Key Insight Analysis_)
		- Click Density Analysis
			- using the site overlay feature, it helps you walk in the shoes of your customer
			- segment your traffic and personalize content differently for visitors from Google vs. Facebook, increasing the customer engagement
		- Visitor Primary Purpose
			- ask customers why they are visiting your site
			- run a survey, do phone interviews, etc.
		- Task Completion Rates
			- Page views != users found what they were looking for
			- Do survey, lab usability, create tests, ...
		- Segmented Visitor Trends
			- old world embedded attributes in JS tags
			- new tools = Click Tracks, Visual Sciences
			- Reports on "Average time on site", "Top search keywords", "popular content"- based on real segmentation of data.
		- Multichannel Impact Analysis
			- Measuring the impact of non-web channels (like TV, newspaper) on your website
			- e.g. how many people use your site but buy your product via retail or phone channel?
- # Web Analytics 2.0
	- | Web Analytics 2.0 | Multiplicity |
	  | -- | -- | 
	  | ![](../assets/web_analytics_2.0_demystified.png) | ![](../assets/web_analytics_multiplicity.png) |
	- Quantitative, Qualitative, Competetive analytics
	- Paradox of Data
		- Lack of data -> cannot make complete decisions
		- Lots of data -> less insights
	- __Multiplicity__
		- one tool from each layer/pillar for better insights
		- 1. Clickstream data (WHAT)
			- click-level data
			- visits, visitors, source, time on site, page views, etc.
			- great at answering "WHAT", but not "WHY"
			- e.g, tools like WebTrends, Google Analytics
		- 2. Multiple Outcome Analysis (HOW MUCH)
			- measuring outcome means connecting customer behavior to the bottom line of the company
			- outcome types of a webiste
				- increased revenue
				- reduced cost
				- improve customer satisfaction/loyalty
		- 3. Experimentation and Testing (WHY)
			- Launch fast, fail/succeed fast `Experiment or Die`
			- A/B and multivariate testing
			- Tools: Google Website Optimizer, Adobe Analytics Target
		- 4. Voice of Customer (WHY)
			- What customers wanted, but did not find
			- e.g., surveys, lab usability testing, remote usability testing, card sorts, etc.
		- 5. Competitive Intelligence (WHAT ELSE)
			- compare your performance with your competitors
			- gether info on your direct and indirect competitors
		- > Knowing how you are performing is good; Knowing how your competitors are performing is priceless.
		- Maxamine/ObservePoint
			- missing JavaScript tags, duplicative content, security & privacy compliance, black holes not crawled by search engine, broken links/forms.
		- Coradiant
			- Why conversion rates are low? Pages are slow or missing?
