- ## Divide the writing into 4 separate tasks
  collapsed:: true
	- MACJ - Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge
	- **Madman**
		- gathers ideas and material first. Dumps all the best idea to come early by methodically brainstorming at the beginning of the process.
	- **Architect**
		- organizes the madman's raw material into a sensible outline. Distills ideas into 3 main propositions.
		- Categorize the main points in sets of three (4 or more is too much)
	- **Carpenter**
		- Write the draft copy as quickly as possible using architect's outline and madman's ideas without worrying about perfecting the prose.
		- Don't get stuck waiting for an inspiration. Try giving yourself 5 to 10 minutes for each section when drafting.
		- Don't edit and perfect until the draft is finished.
		- If you are stuck with something, move to the next section.
	- **Judge**
		- assume the role of the Judge to edit, polish, and improve the piece. Do this in several distinct passes, each time focusing on only one element of your writing.
	- Approach the writing as a series of manageable tasks using the MACJ method.
