- Web architecture types
	- Micro frontends
	- Isomorphic apps (SSR)
	- PWA apps
	- Web assembly
- # Overview
	- Micro Frontends are the technical representation of a business sub-domain, they allow independent implementations with same or different technology choices, finally they avoid sharing logic with other sub-domains and they are owned by a single team.

	- ### Advantages of Micro Frontends
	  
	  * Ease of innovation
	  * Easy to manage
	  * Easy to upgrade to new component or technology
	  * Ease of deployment due to lack of inter-dependency
	  * Quick time to market
	  * Technology independence across frontends (but don't do this)
	  * Each team has clear ownership
	  * Promotes Domain-Driven Design
	- ### Challenges in Micro Frontends
	  
	  * first call takes a long time
	  * difficult to be indexed by search engines, crawlers, etc.
	  
	  
	  * Share nothing across front ends e.g., CSS stylesheets
	  * Diamond anti-pattern
	    * Webcomponents.org
	    * Polymer-lit
	    * Stencil js
	    * Skate js (Netlify)
	  * Module loader - SystemJS

- # Design
	- ## Domain Modeling (DDD)
		- Domains
		- Sub-domains
			- Core subdomain e.g., core business function like video streaming for Netflix
			- Generic subdomain e.g., payment processing
			- Supportive subdomain e.g., recommendation engine
		- A team can own more than one subdomain
	- ## Design Considerations
		- 4 things to consider in µFE architecture
		- ### 1.Definition
			- Use _APIs First Design Principle_
			    * APIs are the first user interface of your app
			    * APIs come first, then the implementation
		- ### 2.Composition
			- Client-side composition
			  * Edge-side composition
			  * Server-side composition
		- ### 3.Routing
			- Router is responsible for intercepting and validate JWTs before redirecting to a µFE page
		- ### 4.Communication
			- ![](../assets/microfrontend_window_comm.png)
			- e.g., window object or redux
			- Window object is the centralized place where all the components in the page can access the data from. Kind of follows the [Redux data flow pattern](https://redux.js.org/basics/data-flow/).
			- Having a global object/variable in window object is against the µFE encapsulation?
- # Implementation
  collapsed:: true
	- There are 3 things essential for any micro frontend application or framework.
	- Load component scripts onto the page e.g., ScriptJS, [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) (module/component loader)
		- Single SPA is layered on SystemJS
	- Instantiate the components and place them in the DOM. e.g., [SingleSPA](https://single-spa.js.org/)
	- Communication of data between the components
		- SingleSPA leaves it up to you
	- ## Types of Implementation
		- __iFrames__ - _used by Spotify_
		- __Shell as proxy__
			- Common logic like auth can be shared in shell
		- __Web Components__ - Polymer
		- Bootstrap
		- [Open Components](http://opencomponents.github.io) - _used by [OpenTable](https://opentable.com)_
		- Interface Framework - _Zalando uses mosaic9, tailor.js_
		- Edge Side Include (ESI) - _used by IKEA_
		- Reverse proxy
			- Auth logic must be duplicated in multiple places since Nginx can't have business logic
		- Using API gateway
			- e.g., Ambassador
		- __Micro frontend ownership__: a team must do all the below: develop, test, build, deploy, document, live-support
- # Open Questions
  collapsed:: true
	- how authentication works? how session management is handled?
	- how communication between µFEs work?
	- how multiple µFEs are integrated to form an app? build time or runtime?
