	- Fortune requires leverage. Business requires 3 broad classes of leverage:
		- One form is **labor**: other humans working for you. Not a great one in this modern age. Managing people is incredibly messy.
		- **Money**: is a good as a form of leverage. It's been the dominant form of leverage in the last century.
		- **Products with no marginal cost of replication**: This is the new and most democratic form. This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer – you don't need anyone's permission. That's why they are very egalitarian and great equalizers of leverage.
	- Capital and Labor are **permissioned** leverages - meaning someone has to give you money or people should follow to run a business
	- Code and social media are **permissionless** leverages - anyone can code an app or start a social media channel to make money
	- Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate.
	- Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay.

- ## Building Wealth
	- If your long term goal is making wealth, ask yourself
		- *Is this authentic to me?*
		- *Is it myself that I am projecting?*
		- *Am I productizing it?*
		- *Am I scaling it with labor or capital or with code or with media?*
	- **Society's needs**
		- Society will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn't yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn't need you.
		- Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time.
			- e.g., oil was a technology that made JD. Rockefeller rich
			- cars - Henry Ford
			- EV - Elon Musk
		- Society always wants new things. If you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of these things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you within your skill set, and within your capabilities.
	- **Scale**
		- You have to figure out how to scale it because if you only build one, that's not enough.
	- **Specific knowledge**
		- Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned
		- When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn't even consider a skill, but people around you noticed.
		- Specific knowledge is sort of a weird combination of unique traits from your DNA, your unique upbringing, and your response to it.
		- No one can compete with you on being you.
		- Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion.
			- Very often, specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It's also stuff that's only now being figured out or is really hard to figure out. If you're not 100% into it, somebody else who is 100% into it will outperform you.
		- Escape competition through authenticity
			- When you're competing with people, it's because you are copying them. It is because you are trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don't copy.
		- Perpetual learning
			- The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner.
			- It is much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in 9 to 12 months than to have studied the "right" thing a long time ago.
			- Foundations are super important.
			- Being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.
			- Knowing how to be persuasive when speaking is far more important than being an expert digital marketer or click optimizer. It's much better to be a 9/10 or 10/10 on foundations than to try and get super deep into things.
			- You do need to be deep in something because otherwise you will be **a mile wide and an inch deep** and you won't get what you want out of life.
		- Compounding
			- Compounding in business relationships is very important.
			- Compounding interest also happens in your reputation.
			- When it comes to the goal-oriented life, only about 1% of the efforts you made paid off.
	- Build or buy an equity in business
		- If you don't own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim.
	- ### Find a position of leverage
		- Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money.
		- If you have hobbies around your intellectual curiosity, you're more likely to develop these passions.
		- When you do things for their own sake, you create your best work.
		- If they can train you to do it, they eventually they will train a computer to do it.
		- You get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and doesn't know how to get elsewhere.
		- The problem is becoming good at whatever "it" is. It moves around from generation to generation, but a lot of it happens to be in technology.
		- As a worker, you want to be as leveraged as possible so you have a huge impact without as much time or physical effort.
	- ### Disconnect b/w input and output
		- 40 hour work weeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes – train and sprint, then sprint and reassess.
		- If you are looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it's going to be very hard to create wealth.
		- Real estate agent - especially in high-end sales - get paid really well. It is a job with input and output disconnected.
		- Tools and leverage create the disconnect between inputs and outputs. The higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs.
	- ### Earn with your mind, not time
		- Start up companies, for instance, add code-based leverage on top of money-based leverage and labor-based leverage.
		- This kind of combination allows you to create something bigger and bigger and get closer and closer to owning all the upside, not just being paid a salary.
	- ### Get paid for judgement
		- Get paid for judgement, not work. Every human should aspire to being knowledgeable about certain things and being paid for our unique knowledge.
		- Judgement – especially demonstrated judgement, with high accountability and a clear track record – is critical.
			- > We waste our time with short-term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffet spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades.
		- Being at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage.
	- ### Priority and focus
		- Set a very high personal hourly rate and you have to stick to it.
		- Always factor your time into every decision. How much time does it take? It's going to take you an hour to get across town to get something. If you value yourself at $100/hr, that's basically throwing $100 out of your pocket. Are you going to do that?
		- If you can outsource something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don't do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them.
	- ### Types of games
		- There are 2 types of games that people play in life
			- Money games
			- Status games
		- Money games
			- Money is not going to solve all problems, but it is going to solve all of your money problems.
			- The business world has many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the crowd.
			- If you get into a relative mindset, you are always going to hate people who do better than you, you are always going to be jealous or envious of them.
		- Status games
			- Status is a zero sum game. It's a very old game.
			- It's hierarchical. Who's number one, number two, etc.? For number 3 to move to number 2, number 2 has to move out of that slot. So that's a zero-sum game.
