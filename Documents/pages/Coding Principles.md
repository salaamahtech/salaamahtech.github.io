# Clean Code
	- > ***A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship - Bob Martin***
	- ## Naming
		- Don't reveal implementation detail in variables. e.g., declare `accounts` instead `accountList`
		- Use single letter variables only as a local variable
		- No need for prefix on variables and class names. e.g., `ICustomer` interface
		- Class name should NOT be a verb. Avoid words like `Manager`, `Processor`, `Data` or `Info`
		- Use a common word per concept across method names and class names. e.g., `fetch(), get(), retrieve()`. Stick to one.
	- ## Function
	  collapsed:: true
		- Function should do one thing only. One level of abstraction per function.
		- Switch statement - tolerated if it appears only once at very low level. Hide it with 'AbstractFactory' and polymorphism.
		- Function arguments
		  collapsed:: true
			- Number of arguments
				- **Niladic** (zero args) - Best
				- **Monadic** (1) - Better
				- **Dyadic** (2) - Good
				- **Polyadic** (multiple) - Needs good justification
		- Avoid functions with output arguments. e.g., `public boolean foo(String input, String output);`
		- Passing flags as arguments is ugly. Based on the flag value, the function might perform one or more things. .e.g., `render(boolean isSuite)`. Split the logic into `renderForSuite()` and `renderForSingleTest()` to make it explicit.
		- Ambiguity issue with dyadic or polyadic functions with same type of arguments. e.g, `assertEquals(int expected, int actual)`. Make function explicit as `assertExpectedEqualsActual(int, int)`.
		- Fix for polyadic functions
		  collapsed:: true
			- Club the different arguments into an object and pass that object as input argument
			- Or, make those arguments are field variables. (only for private functions)
		- **Side effects**
		  collapsed:: true
			- A function promises to do one thing, but it also does other hidden things. e.g., `checkPassword(String user, String password)` method which authenticates and initializes a user session. Session initialization part is hidden from user.
			- Side effects create temporal couplings and order dependencies. *Temporal couplings- mean that the function can only be invoked at certain times. In the above example, if it is called out of order the current session data might be destroyed.
		- **Double take** - Any line of code within function that forces you to look at the function signature, then it is called "double take".
		- **Prefer exceptions to return error codes** - Function should do one thing. Error handling is another thing. Extract try..catch in a separate function.
		  
		  ```java
		  if (delete(page) == OK){
		     ....
		  } else {
		     Error out
		  }
		  ```
		  
		  ```java
		  try{
		  ...
		  } catch (...){
		  //Error processing is separated from the happy path
		  } 
		  ```
		- **Command Query Separation**: Functions should either do something or return something, but not both.

	- ## Formatting
		- **Vertical Openness** - Each group of lines should represent a thought. e.g., `given`, `when` & `then` blocks in unit testing
		- **Vertical density** implies close association of those lines
		- **Vertical distance** - concepts that are closely related should be kept close to each other. e.g.,
			- local variable declarations should right before its usage.
			- Instance variables should be at the top of the file, not bottom.
			- Dependent functions should be closer to each other.
- ## Object and Data Structures
	- Getters & Setters - Think before adding them. Blindly adding on every variable beats the purpose of abstraction.
	- **Law of Demeter** - method chaining on data structure method is ok.
