# Notes
collapsed:: true
	- __Dashboard Renaissance - Cory from Splunk__
		- Book: The Design of Everyday Things by Dan Norman
		- What's the goal/purpose of this dashboard?
		- what action to take?
		- most important things in your dashboard should be on the top left and least important on bottom right
		- What to include
			- RED and USE techniques
			- prefer symptoms over causes
		- Pre-attentive processing - position, angle/slope, size/length, volume, color/density
		- What chart type
			- Heatmaps show outliers
			- Saturation is low accuracy
			- Bar charts - better for comparison of a few values
		- Scales, Units, Norms, Labels
		- https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/visual-design.html - accessibility
	- __Before, During, and After Chaos - Nora Jones @nora_js__
		- Different phases of Chaos Engineering
		- Chaos Engineering
			- O'Reilly e-book
			- AWS re:Invent 2017 Nora Jones - Youtube video
		- obscure hindsight bias
		- Serial propensity effect -

	- __Logs, Metrics, endpoints - Bryan Liles -  Tanzu Build, VMWare__
		- Logging best practices
			- Best format: JSON. (Jsonnet?). slf4j for json format?
			- log to stdout
			- syslog - logs at scale
			- add context to your log messages
		- Metrics
			- USE (, saturation, ),
			- RED (rate, error, duration),
			- Four Golden Signals (latency, traffic, error, saturation) - this may work better at scale
			- Best practices
				- OpenMetrics/Prometheus
				- Keep the number of metrics to manageable size (may be 100s, not 1000s)
		- Endpoints
			- TCP, HTTP, Custom Reponse
			- Best practices - look at the deck
		- Traces
			- Distributed tracing (OpenTracing, Jaeger)
			- traces are composed of spans
		- OpenTelemetry - capture metrics and distributed traces
	- Jeff from Netflix
		- Mantis - Open source streaming microservices monitoring solution
			- answers new questions that you forgot to log
			- low latency
			- cost-effective
	- __Developing meaningful SLIs__ - Alex Hidalgo (Squarespace Engineering http://slidesgala.com)
		- Service Level Indicator
		- SLI (engineering) = User journey (product team) = KPI (business)
	- __M.E.L.T. Level Up - Ron from NewRelic__
		- MELT
			- Metrics - Micrometer, Istio, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, DropWizard
			- Events - alerts and deployments are example of events
			- Logs - json:api, fluentbit, cloudwatch,
			- Traces - Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Istio
		- Platform - Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Istio, Micrometer, DropWizard
	- LightStep
		- Tech paper - Dapper, distributed tracing paper
	- [Stackdriver](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/) monitoring from Google
	- __Designing Alerts to Direct Attention - Ryan Frantz__
		- https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/3-brain-technologies-to-watch-in-2018
		- Mental model of a system
	- __Fitness Function-Driven Development - Rosemary WAng ThoughtWorks__
		- Evolutionary Architecture
		- Fitness function - borrowed from Genetrics algorithm
			- SLO can be a Fit func
		- Benefits
			- KonMari method for former assumptions, tools and telemetry
			- Highlights gaps in process, tooling and telemetry
			- open discussions for tech deby
			- develop mutual learning context

	- __Presentation - Pete Cheslock @petecheslock__
		- http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2011/06/why-monitoring-sucks.html
		- https://mattturck.com/data2019/
		- Logging best practices
			- Log in JSON format
			- put everything in the json
			- send it all to your Data Lake (georgehart.com)
		- Presentation Material: https://pete.wtf/decks/MonitoramaBaltimore2019.pdf
	- __How to interview__
		- Diversity
		- Preparation - get trained on interviewing. be comfortable
		- Read the job description. Find the right candidate for the job. This isn't about you
		- Read the CV. Don't Google - beware of legal issues
		- Pair up
		- Present yourself professionally - don't take phone calls
		- Colloborate, don't confront
	- Adopting a Product mindset for SRE and Observability teams
	- You canâ€™t spell "monitoring" without "monoid" - Kevin from NewRelic
		- Easy is not the same as simple - Rich Hikey's talk - e.g., Writing simple code is not easy
		- What is Monoid? a single algebraic structure with a single
			- Temporal and dimensional aggregation
	- __Observability Graph - Homin Lee from Datadog__
		- Corollary to Conway's Law: Observability follows your org chart.
		- Gore's hypothesis (Goretex fabric)
			- a.k.a. prequel to Dunbar's number
			- a.k.a. thing you heard about from The Tipping Point
		- Graph with ontology is Knowledge graph
	- __Observing Observability__ - Philip O'Toole from Google Cloud
		- Why observability is difficult
