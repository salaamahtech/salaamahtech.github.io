	- ## 1:1 Meetings
	  collapsed:: true
		- __Structure of your 1:1__
			- I like to keep things unstructured in 1:1 for the team members to tell me what they want to discuss. I always tell them this is their time to share what's on their mind.
			- If I see any performance concerns, I deliver constructive feedbacks in these sessions.
			- I generally make every 4th 1:1 as a Retro meeting to discuss improvements to my 1:1s.
			- Example of an engineer who benefitted from 1:1. e.g., someone asked for cloud Lambda work, who used to primarily work only in backend Java development.
		- __What are your 1:1 philosophies?__
			- _I generally don't focus on tactical or daily project issues on 1:1. I tend to focus on how I can help grow this person. I ask myself and my direct reports, who in the team can eventually succeed me or you and how close they are._
			- Find out what drives them, what skill gaps they might want to address, and where they want to be in a year.
