	- ### Definition
		- Reinforcement Learning takes an approach similar to behavioral psychology. Instead of a training a model with predefined training sets (i.e., where you know the prescribed answers in advance) as in supervised learning, reinforcement learning rewards the algorithm when it performs the correct action (behavior).
		- is somewhat less commonly used. This is useful for learning how to act or behave when given occasional reward or punishment signals. (For example, consider how a baby learns to walk.)
		- Successful implementations: Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, self-driving cars
