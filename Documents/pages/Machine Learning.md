	- ### Definition
		- Reinforcement Learning takes an approach similar to behavioral psychology. Instead of a training a model with predefined training sets (i.e., where you know the prescribed answers in advance) as in supervised learning, reinforcement learning rewards the algorithm when it performs the correct action (behavior).
		- is somewhat less commonly used. This is useful for learning how to act or behave when given occasional reward or punishment signals. (For example, consider how a baby learns to walk.)
		- Successful implementations: Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, self-driving cars

	- Deep Learning is a subset of AI that attempts to develop computer systems that learn using **neural networks** like those in the human brain.
	- While ML is mostly about optimization, deep learning is more focused on creating algorithms to simulate how the human brain's neurons work.
	- Deep Learning algorithms are composed of interconnected web of nodes called **neurons** and the edges that join them together.
	- Neural nets receive inputs, perform calculations, and then use this output to solve given problems.
