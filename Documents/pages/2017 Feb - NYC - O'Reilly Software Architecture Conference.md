	  collapsed:: true
		- Sample code: http://github.com/henrikengstrom/sa-2017-akka
		- Circuit-breakers - technique for resiliency. disallow customers from calling the service when it reaches the breaking point
		- [Reactive manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org)
			- Responsive
			- Resilient (self-healing)
			- Elastic
			- Message Driven
		- Actors live inside a container called 'Actor System'.
		- Actors are location-transparent. One can send a message to another actor which could be one a different node
		- Akka Persistence - Event Sourcing style persistence, enables CQRS style architectures
		- Akka Streams - Back Pressure
		- JDK 9 - reactive streams support - java.util.current.flow, Websockets?
		- Akka HTTP
		- Alpakka is similar in goals to Apache Camel

	- ## Keynotes
	  collapsed:: true
		- __The evolution and future of Software Architecture__ (Mark Richards)
			- Agility, Velocity, Modularity, Testability, Performance, Scalability, Simplicity, Reliability
			- Streaming solutions
			- Autonomic self-healing systems that can monitor themselves and adapt to their environment
			- James Blieck - Faster
		- __Computers are easy; people are hard__ (Bridget Kromhout, Pivotal)
			- @honest_status, @ntakayama
			- Manager role is not a promotion, it's a different job
		- __Introduction to serverless__ (Mike Roberts, Symphonia)
			- Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
				- Google Firebase (DB for Mobile developers)
				- Auth0
				- AWS solution?
			- Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS)
				- Triggers a function on a particular event - creates a new container, executes the function, returns result, destroys container
				- Events like message-event, time event, network file system, http requests
				- Faas = no management of Server hardware or server processes
				- AWS Lambda
			- Serverless = BaaS + FaaS
			- Common traits of serverless
				- no management of server hosts or server processes
				- self autoscale and auto provision based on load
				- costs based on precise usage (zero usage = zero cost). e.g., 5 mins of EC2 instance, you are paying for extra 55 mins of idle host
				- performance capabilities defined in terms other than host size/count
				- implicit high availability (not necessarily disaster recovery)
			- Why serverless?
				- cheaper
				- better (experts manage the complex parts. let other people do the repetitive work for you),
				- faster to develop and deploy apps
			- Adrian Cockroft - youtube video
			- Dangers
				- re-architect the app
				- state management

	- ## From VMs to Containers: A DevOps Journey
	  collapsed:: true
		- David Grizzanti (Comcast)
		- From where we started
			- Tickets for everything
			- Manual build and push of an RPM via puppet
			- Hardware load balancing + VIPs (virtual IPs)
			- Logging & Metrics
			- Separate dev and ops team
		- Tech stack:
			- Apache Mesos
			- Marathon
			- Docker
			- [Weave](https://www.weave.works/weave-discovery-and-docker-swarm/)
			- HashiCorp's [Consul](https://www.consul.io) - service discovery, secret management

		- Good
			- Scala sbt kicking off Docker container for build/testing?
			- Jenkins - how to integrate with Docker?
		- Bad
			- Visibility into the containers - e.g., checking the logs from more than one container. Mesos/Marathon comes for help
			- Significant decrease in performance - caused by Docker log driver taking CPU cycles during log compression
			- Application teardown - SIGKILL vs SIGTERM

			- As a system designer security begins and ends with you
			- Threat Modeling
			- First
				- Open your system diagram
				- for every line, add a protocol
				- for every box, add the assets in transit aand at rest, and the controls in play
				- draw boundaries around logical network groupings
			- Second
				- Identify any assets with weak or missing controls
				- identify all points of entry into the system
				- list the bisiness objectives, goals and risks
				- map business risks to assets missing controls

	- ## An architect's guide to evaluating cloud services: 10 things to consider 
	  collapsed:: true
		- Matt Stein ( [Software Architecture Radio](http://www.softwarearchitecturerad.io) )
		- Business Requirement
		  collapsed:: true
			- What is the business problem you are trying to solve?
			- How does this type of service address the problem?
			- how do providers of this type of service differentiate themselves with respect to your business problem?
		- Resiliency
		  collapsed:: true
			- What are your resiliency requirements?
				- Availabilty
				- Consistency
				- PArtition tolerance
				- Durability - Load balancers, service registry, have state
		- Security
		  collapsed:: true
			- Authentication
				- how does a client prove identity
				- how are credentials provisioned/stored
				- how are credentials delivered
				- how are credentials rotated
			- Authorization
				- what permission types are supported
				- are permissions grouped into roles
				- are roles customizable
				- how are roles assigned to actors
		- Regulatory Compliance
			- data residency/sovereignty - e.g., German companies want data stored only in Germany
			- encryption
			- Data at Rest
				- hardware level: disk encryption
				- encrypting data files in a DB
				- application level: encrypted password on a row level in DB
			- Data in Flight
		- Auditability
			- what happened
			- when did it happen
			- what actor caused it
			- where did it happen
			- why did it happen
		- Certification Checkboxes
			- SOX compliant
			- PCI
			- HIPAA
			- FedRAMP
			- NIST 800-53
			- FIPS 140-2, ...
		- Economics
			- who is operating the service? public cloud, hybrid, private cloud
			- what is your expected rate of consumption
			- how is your rate of consumption projected to grow
			- how is the service priced/costed
			- is the equation cost effective relative to your consumption rate and growth rate?
		- Scalability
			- do you need to scale?
			- how id your load/volume expected to grow? don't go for some fancy auto-scaling mechanism if you don't need it.
			- is your load/volume busty?
			- is your load/volume unpredictable?
			- does the service support scaling according to these needs?
		- Provider 'Lock-In'
			- is there a sensible way to leverage multiple providers
			- is the service supported by open/defacto standards
			- is there a meaningful abstraction layer
			- are you subject to "data gravity"? Amazon provides a truck to migrate your data from your data center to AWS. Now what if you wanted to move out of AWS? Will that vendor provide a truck?
		- Available Tooling
			- how good is the documentation
			- does the service have a well designed API
			- are client libraries available for your language(s) of choice?
			- Does your app framework of choice support the service?
			- is good management tooling available?
			- is there a management API?
			- is there automation tooling available for management?
		- Undifferentiated heavy lifting
			- what gaps do you need to close that EVERYONE has to close?
			- what will it cost you to close those gaps?
			- what will it cost you to keep them closed?
			- are there ecosystem partners in ths business of closing these gaps?
			- is the provider working on closing these gaps?
		- Differentiating Features
			- (this is where we often start, but is the least important one. Don't look for the latest shiny thing)
			- there's a lot of parity out there
			- but could be the decision maker (AWS, Azure, Google - Google has its own fiber for networking)
		- Scorecard
			- summarized view of why you made a particular choice
			- you want an organized way to demonstrate why you made your decision
			- Scorecard
				- KISS
				- No binary
				- Simple ranges: 1-3 or 1-5
				- Add weights for prioritization
				- Call out subcategories when valuable
	- ## It’s not continuous delivery if you can’t deploy right now.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Ken Mugrage (ThoughtWorks ) - [GoCD](https://www.thoughtworks.com/go/)
		- Job of a a pipeline is to avoid release candidates
		- Continuous deployment is not continuous delivery. Deployment is installing in prod. Delivery/Release is when the business approves to toggle the flag and users start to see the changes.
		- Recommended CI practices
			- everyone commits to trunk at least daily
			- automates tests are run for evey commit
			- avoid branches
		- Releasing incomplete work
			- [Feature toggles](http://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)
				- Don't confuse deploy with release
		- Pipelines you should be including
			- test before you commit http://thoughtworks.github.io/talisman
			- have you included private keys? Authentication tokens?
			- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - like FindBugs?
			- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
		- Performance Testing
			- Load testing - simplest form of performance testing.
			- Stress testing - to understand the upper limits of capacity within the system
			- Soak testing (or endurance testing) is usually done to determine if the system can sustain the continuous expected load
			- Spike testing
		- Build pipeline
			- Run as much as possible in parallel
		- Managing Risk
			- Deployment patterns
				- Canary release
				- Dark launching - Facebook messenger trial running their app selectively
				- http://githubengineering.com/move-fast
			- Feeback loops
				- create useful logging for everything
				- Run (some of) your tests against production
				- Ensure alerts are useful
			- Optimized for Recovery
				- MTBF (Mean time between failures)
				- MTTR (Mean time to repair)
				- State of devops report
			- Knight Capital
				- deployed untested software to prod which had an obsolete function. Incident happened due to a techician forgetting to copy the new Retail Liquidity Program (Lack of automated testing costed the company $440,000,000)
	- ## Hybrid cloud deployment patterns using Kubernetes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Sandeep Parikh (Google)
		- Kubernetes, Pods, Services, Replica Sets, Namespaces, Container Engine
		- Deployment Types
			- Hybrid, heterogenous, multi-cloud, public/private
			- _Heterogenous_
				- Why Heterogenous
					- maxed out resources
					- limited geo reach
					- high availability
					- avoid vendor lock-in
					- comuter flexibility
					- access to services
				- Heterogenous is hard
			- _Multiple cloud_
				- Auto-scaling is hard
				- Load balancing
		- Service spec
			- Handling requests with Ingress
		- Federation
			- Why?
				- Sync resources across clusters
				- cross-cluster service discovery
				- HA apps
			- Why not?
				- increased network bandwidth and cost
				- reduced cross-cluster isolation
				- each deployment is a snowflake (https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html)

			- Backends for frontends (http://thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/bff-soundcloud)
		- _4_ Design microservices with open APIs in mind
			- [12 factor apps](https://12factor.net)
		- _5_ Cloud-native is much more than just cloud-washed
		- Containers
			- Cloud Foundry uses Garden
		- _6_ Microservices and containers are often used together, but also work very well without each other
			- http://github.com/cncf/landscape
			- http://slideshare.net/cdavisafc/cloud-foundry-technical-overview
		- _7_ Be cloud platform-agnostic
		- _8_ containers are low-level technology. Only the infrastructure provider should care, but not the app developer
		- _9_ Automation (CI/CD/DevOps) and cultural changes are key changes to success
		- _10_ Cloud native middleware microservices leverage various technologies, open source frameworks and infrastructure components like containers or messaging
