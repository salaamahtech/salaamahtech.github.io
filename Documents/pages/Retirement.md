# Retirement Plan Types
	- ## 1. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans
		- ### a. 401(k)
			- #### How 401(k) works
			- **Plan sponsor**: your employer
			- **Plan administer**: employer hires a mutual fund company or a brokerage firm to manage the plan and its investments.
				- finite set of investment options are provided by employer typically are mutual funds, company stock, etc.
			- **Asset Allocation**: you decide how much and where to invest.
			- **Funding option**: funding happens thru payroll deduction
			- **Matching Contribution**:
				- For every dollar you invest, company pays you \$0.5 to \$1.0, which is free.
				- Matching contributions usually vest over time, typically 25% every year or all at once after 3 yrs. If you leave or let go before that, you get nothing.
				- No tax for matching contribution until you withdraw them in retirement.
			- **Withdrawal** - If you withdraw before age 59.5, you pay 10% penalty on top of income tax. IRS waives the penalty for certain hardship withdrawals like sudden disability, higher education expenses, etc. You could take loan as well.
			- **Switching Jobs** - You have 4 options
				- 1. Move money to personal IRA rollover accounts - at a mutual fund company or discount brokerage so that the money grows tax deferred. Make sure you choose 'direct rollover' where the old employer pays a check to the fund company/brokerage firm. If it is made out to you, the money is taxed.
				- 2. Move money to new employer's plan
				- 3. Leave the money right where it is - Your former employer may not allow you to stay in the plan if your account balance is less than $5,000, however. And because you're no longer an employee, you may miss out on important information about plan changes and investment options.
				- 4. Cash out: pay penalty and taxes.
			- **RMD (Required Minimum Withdrawal)** - At age 70.5, you must make minimum withdrawals.

			- Pros
			- Sock away large amount of cash without paying taxes.
			- No annual contribution limit for an annuity.

			- Tips
			- Buy annuities only after maxing out 401(k) plans and IRAs.
