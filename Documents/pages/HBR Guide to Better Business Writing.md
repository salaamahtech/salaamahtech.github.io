- #Books #[[Leadership Concepts]]
-
- **Understand the purpose of writing**
	- Know why you are writing. Know what you want the outcome to be.
		- Say clearly and convincingly, what the issue is and what you want to accomplish.
		- Focus on the reaction you are trying to elicit from the reader.
-
- **Understand your reader**
	- Respect your reader’s time constraints. Understand that your readers have no time to waste: Get to the point quickly and clearly to ensure that your message gets read.
		- Use a tone appropriate to your audience.
		- Highlight the important thing “*what’s in it for them*”. If they can easily see how your message is relevant to them, they will be more likely to read it and respond.
		- Connect with particular reader to connect with larger audiences. If you focus on a smart nonspecialist who is in your audience, you’ll strike a balance between sophistication and accessibility. Your writing will be more appealing and persuasive.
-
- Divide the writing into a series of 4 separate tasks using the MACJ method. (*Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge*)
	- **Madman**
		- gathers ideas and material first. Dumps all the best idea to come early by methodically brainstorming at the beginning of the process.
	- **Architect**
		- organizes the madman’s raw material into a sensible outline. Distills ideas into 3 main propositions.
			- Categorize the main points in sets of three (4 or more is too much)
	- **Carpenter**
		- Write the draft copy as quickly as possible using architect’s outline and madman’s ideas without worrying about perfecting the prose.
			- Don’t get stuck waiting for an inspiration. Try giving yourself 5 to 10 minutes for each section when drafting.
			- Don’t edit and perfect until the draft is finished.
			- If you are stuck with something, move to the next section.
	- **Judge**
		- assume the role of the Judge to edit, polish, and improve the piece. Do this in several distinct passes, each time focusing on only one element of your writing.

- **The Who-Why-What-When-How Chart**
	- Who are you writing for? Consider your audience’s concerns, motivations, and background.
		- Why are you writing? Keep your purposes firmly in mind. Every sentence should advance it.
		- What needs saying? Include only the main points and details that will get your message across.
		- When are you expecting actions to be taken? State your time frame.
		- How will your communication benefit your readers? Make it clear to readers how you’re meeting their needs.
