1. Think of yourself as the CEO for your team/projects/tasks. The most impactful CEOs know what they want their legacy to be before leaving their seat. What do you want to be remembered for? Work on that without delay

- 2. Tone is set at the top. Never underestimate the power of the example you set, and the importance of picking the right people to lead teams/projects/tasks
- 3. Seek feedback from your stakeholders on a broad basis. You can't manage/improve what you don't know. Ignore client feedback at your peril. Clients who feel ignored will learn not to need you
- 4. Strive for excellence. People change their opinion of you only after you have behaved contrary to their expectations on multiple occasions (some research indicates it is as much as 12 times!). If you leave a bad impression, it may take years to correct
- 5. Time is the great equalizer. Be very conscious of where/how you spend it. The topic which you would be most uncomfortable discussing with someone very senior is often a good indicator of where to spend your time
- 6. Prioritize meaningful and mutually beneficial business relationships over networking. Trust is established by consistently delivering outstanding results
- 7. Treat people well. Mutual respect and courtesy are requirements for lasting collaboration
- 8. Teamwork is key to solving worthwhile problems. Be honest with yourself and with others as to where you can add value, and where you need help
- 9. To get things done, you have to: i) influence the right people; ii) accept that timeframes and sequencing need to be negotiated; iii) be willing to do heavy lifting for the things that are most important to you
- 10. Be willing to compromise, but when you have particularly strong convictions, learn to explain yourself in a manner that is calm, respectful, and firm
- 11. Measure the things you care about, make them transparent, and make them a frequent topic of conversation with the appropriate stakeholders. Results will follow
- 12. When presenting to senior management, obey the "3 thing rule". If you have more than 3 soundbites, rework your pitch
- 13. Expect your promotions to be a confirmation process. If you expect promotions to be a stretch assignment, adjust both your expectations, and your behavior
- 14. Expect moments of disappointment in your career just as you expect them in life. In both cases: i) disappointment is often less personal than you may imagine; ii) comparing yourself to others will be tempting, but is seldom fruitful
- 15. Life is short. A rewarding career will likely be a significant portion of your life experience. You owe it to yourself, and those around you, to enjoy the ride
