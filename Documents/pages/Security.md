# Overview
background-color:: yellow
collapsed:: true
	- Application Security has 4 aspects:
		- **Authentication** - proving user identity, often called user ‘login'.
		- **Authorization** - access control
		- **Cryptography** - protecting or hiding data from prying eyes
		- **Session Management** - per-user time-sensitive state
	- ## Core Concepts
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![](../assets/shiro-basics.png)
		- 3 Main concepts in security
			- 1. Subject - "the currently executing user". It could be more than a human user. e.g., daemon apps, 3rd party apps, etc.
			- 2. SecurityManager - manages security operations for all users
			- 3. Realm - acts the bridge/connector between the security provider and your application'' security data like user accounts, access controls, etc.
- # 1. Authentication
  background-color:: yellow
	- Process of verifying a user's identity. Also called 'login' process.
	- `Authentication Token = Principal/username + Credential/password`
	- If the submitted credentials match what the system expects for that user identity (principal), the user is considered authenticated.
	- ## Authentication Methods
	  background-color:: pink
		- **Weaker forms** of authentication
			- Static password
			- Knowledge-based Authentication (KBA): security questions
		- **Stronger forms** of authentication
			- **OTP** (One-time password)
				- The OTP is often a numeric code that is generated by an application and sent to the user at the time of authentication
				- a one-time password can be generated by an application on a user device or by a specialized hardware OTP display token.
			- Biometric factors
			- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
				- Password (*what you know*) + OTP generated from a device (*what you have*)
				- MFA is forced when
					- sensitive or admin data is being accessed
					- an unusual situation is detected, such as a user attempting access from a new device or an atypical geographic location.
			- **Step up Authentication**
				- Step-up authentication is the process of authenticating with a stronger form of authentication in order to elevate the authentication assurance level of an existing authentication session.
					- For example, ***level 1***: if a user logs in with a static password, there is some chance the password was stolen and the account is being used by an imposter
					- ***level 2***: when an OTP is involved in addition to static password
				- Authorization policy may require authentication sessions to be at a specific authentication assurance level in order for a user to access resources or execute transactions that involve more risk.
					- For example, in an enterprise, a manager might be able to access the accounts payable system with a password to run reports, but then have to step up their session by authenticating with a one-time password in order to approve a large payment.
	- ## Evolution of Authentication Solutions
	  background-color:: pink
		- ### 1) Per-identity silo
		  background-color:: blue
			- > **Identity owned by**: an organization
			- Cons
				- User exasperation - managing multiple username, password to remember
				- Profile changes are not in sync
				- Every app implementing siloed identity solution is untenable for business
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716327035254_0.png){:height 401, :width 501}
		- ### 2) Centralized user repo
		  background-color:: blue
			- > **Identity owned by**: an organization
			- Cons
				- Each app is exposed to user password for validation.
				- Compromise in one app puts all the apps at risk
				- Does not maintain any user session. Hence the user has to login separately for each application.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716327316876_0.png){:height 416, :width 310}
		- ### 3) Early SSO servers
		  background-color:: blue
			- > **Identity owned by**: an organization
			- Pros
				- Only SSO server is exposed to password for validation - not each app
				- User session managed here to remember that the user is already authenticated. After app1, the user won't be asked to authenticate again for app2.
			- Cons
				- Interaction between app and SSO server are proprietary
				- Difficult to track employee accounts in SaaS apps
				- This solution relies on cookies - hence only works with one domain. SSO won't work for SaaS apps with a different domain name
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716328199609_0.png){:height 506, :width 476}
		- ### 4) Federated identity & SAML2
		  background-color:: blue
			- **Identity owned by**: an organization
			- Pros
				- Multi-domain SSO applications supported
				- Federated Identity
				- SaaS apps could redirect corporate users back to corp authentication service or IDP for authentication
				- SSO possible for both internal and external apps
			- Cons
				- SAML2 is complex to configure and implement
				- SAML2 solves only authentication - not authorization
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716328915596_0.png){:height 602, :width 788}
		- ### 5) OpenID Protocol
		  background-color:: blue
			- > **Identity owned by:** User (User-centric identity)
			- Pros
				- Consumers could pick their choice of IdP and point apps to it for authentication
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716335731172_0.png){:height 414, :width 504}
		- ### 6) OAuth2
		  background-color:: blue
			- > **Identity owned by:** User (User-centric identity)
			- Pros
				- Consumers could give access to their resources without registering again in external sites
			- Cons
				- OAuth2 was not designed for authentication and could NOT be securely used for it.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716337360677_0.png){:height 539, :width 558}
		- ### 7) OpenID Connect
		  background-color:: blue
			- > **Identity owned by:** User (User-centric identity)
			- Layer on top of OAuth2 to provide info about the identity of an authenticated user in a standard format
			- Pros
				- Can be used for both authenticating users and API authorizations
			-
	- ## Basic Authentication
	  background-color:: pink
	  collapsed:: true
		- Basic authentication is the simplest protocol available for performing authentication over HTTP. It involves sending a Base64-encoded username and password within a request header to the server. With Basic authentication (with and without SSL), your name and password do get automatically Base64- encoded.
		  
		  The server checks to see if the username exists within its system and verifies the sent password. The client needs to send this Authorization header with each and every request it makes to the server.
		- ### Unauthorized request
		  collapsed:: true
			- The 401 response tells the client that it is not authorized to access the URI it tried to invoke on.
			- The **WWW-Authenticate**   header specifies which authentication protocol the client should use.
			- In this case, **Basic**   means basic authentication should be used. The realm attribute identifies a collection of secured resources on a website.
			  
			  ```http Response to an unauthorized request
			  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
			  WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="CustomerDB Realm"
			  ```
		- ### Response with authorization details
		  collapsed:: true
			- To perform authentication, the client must send a request with the Authorization header set to a Base64-encoded string of our username and a colon character, followed by the password. If our username is bburke and our password geheim, the Base64-encoded string of bburke:geheim will be `YmJ1cmtlOmdlaGVpbQ==`.
			- The client needs to send this Authorization header with each and every request it makes to the server.
			  
			  ```http Request with authorization details
			  GET /customers/333 HTTP/1.1
			  Authorization: Basic YmJ1cmtlOmdlaGVpbQ==
			  ```
			- **Downside**: The problem with this approach is that if this request is intercepted by a hostile entity on the network, the hacker can easily obtain the username and password and use it to invoke its own requests. Using an encrypted HTTP connection, HTTPS, solves this problem. With an encrypted connection, a rogue programmer on the network will be unable to decode the transmission and get at the Authorization header. Still, security-paranoid network administrators are very squeamish about sending passwords over the network, even if they are encrypted within SSL packets.
	- ## Digest Authentication
	  background-color:: pink
	  collapsed:: true
		- Digest authentication was invented so that clients would not have to send clear text passwords over HTTP. It involves exchanging a set of secure MD5 hashes of the username, password, operation, URI, and optionally the hash of the message body itself. It is a hash value generated with the following pseudocode:
		- ### Unauthorized request
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```http 
			  GET /dir/index.html HTTP/1.0
			  Host: localhost
			  ```
			- **Response to an unauthorized request**
				- ```http
				  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
				  WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="CustomerDB Realm",
				  qop="auth,auth-int",
				  nonce="12dcde223152321ab99cd",
				  opaque="aa9321534253bcd00121"
				  ```
				- The **nonce**   and **opaque**   attributes are special server-generated keys that will be used to build the subsequent authenticated request.
		- ### Hash calculating algorithm
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```python
			  H1 = md5("username:realm:password")
			  H2 = md5("httpmethod:uri")
			  response = md5("H1:nonce:nc:cnonce:qop:H2")
			  ```
			- The **nonce**   and **opaque**   attributes are a copy of the values sent with the earlier WWWAuthenticate header.
			- The **uri**   attribute is the base URI you are invoking on.
			- The **nc**   attribute is a request counter that should be incremented by the client with each request. This prevents hostile clients from replaying a request.
			- The **cnonce**   attribute is a unique key generated by the client and can be anything the client wants.
			- The **response**   attribute is where all the meat is. It is a hash value generated with the following pseudocode:
			- When the server receives this request, it builds its own version of the **response**   hash using its stored, secret values of the username and password. If the hashes match, the user and its credentials are valid.
			  
			  ```http Request with Authorization details
			  GET /customers/333 HTTP/1.1
			  Authorization: Digest username="bburke",
			  realm="CustomerDB Realm",
			  nonce="12dcde223152321ab99cd",
			  uri="/customer/333",
			  qop="auth",
			  nc=00000001,
			  cnonce="43fea",
			  response="11132fffdeab993421",
			  opaque="aa9321534253bcd00121"
			  ```
		- ### Pros
		  collapsed:: true
			- The password is never used directly by the protocol. For example, the server doesn't even need to store clear text passwords. It can instead initialize its authorization store with pre-hashed values.
			- Also, since request hashes are built with a nonce value, the server can expire these nonce values over time. This, combined with a request counter, can greatly reduce replay attacks.
			  When the server receives this request, it builds its own version of the response hash using its stored, secret values of the username and password. If the hashes match, the user and its credentials are valid.
		- ### Cons
		  collapsed:: true
			- This approach is that unless you use HTTPS, you are still vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where the middleman can tell a client to use Basic authentication to obtain a password.
	- ## X.509 certificates
	  background-color:: pink
	  collapsed:: true
		- HTTPS is not only an encryption mechanism - it can also be used for authentication.
		- How it works?
			- ![](../assets/security-certs.gif)
			- When you first interact with a secure website, your browser receives a digitally signed certificate from the server that identifies it.
			- Your browser verifies this certificate with a central authority like VeriSign. This is how you guarantee the identity of the server you are interacting with and make sure you're not dealing with some *man-in-the-middle* security breach.
		- HTTPS can also perform two-way authentication. In addition to the client receiving a signed digital certificate representing the server, the server can receive a certificate that represents and identifies the client. (See mTLS section below)
			- When a client initially connects to a server, it exchanges its certificate and the server matches it against its internal store.
			- Once this link is established, there is no further need for user authentication, since the certificate has already positively identified the user.
		- > SSL, or Secure Socket Layer, is a technology which allows web browsers and web servers to communicate over a secured connection. This means that the data being sent is encrypted by one side, transmitted, then decrypted by the other side before processing. This is a two-way process, meaning that both the server AND the browser encrypt all traffic before sending out data.
		- > Another important aspect of the SSL protocol is Authentication. This means that during your initial attempt to communicate with a web server over a secure connection, that server will present your web browser with a set of credentials, in the form of a "Certificate", as proof the site is who and what it claims to be. In certain cases, the server may also request a Certificate from your web browser, asking for proof that you are who you claim to be. This is known as "Client Authentication," although in practice this is used more for business-to-business (B2B) transactions than with individual users. Most SSL-enabled web servers do not request Client Authentication.
		- ### Pros
			- Most secure way to perform authentication on web.
		- ### Cons
			- Managing of the certificates is painful. The server must create a unique certificate for each client that wants to connect to the service. From the browser/human perspective, this can be a pain, as the user has to do some extra configuration to interact with the server.
		- ### CLI commands
			- ```bash
			  # to fetch the certificate of google.com
			  openssl s_client -connect google.com:443 2>/dev/null < /dev/null | sed -n '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/p' > google.com.crt
			  
			  # to view the crt file content
			  cat google.com.crt
			  
			  # to view the human-readable content of the certificate
			  openssl x509 -text -noout -in google.com.crt
			  
			  ```

	- ## OpenID Connect
	  background-color:: pink
		- __OpenID__ is the most common open web protocol for handling federated authentication or federated identity.
		- The **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** protocol is the next generation version of OpenID based on OAuth. It provides an identity service layer on top of OAuth 2, designed to allow authorization servers to authenticate users for applications and return the results in a standard way.
		- OIDC enables an application to delegate user authentication to an OAuth 2 authorization server and have it return to the application a set of claims about the authenticated user and authentication event in a standard format.
		- Few other identity protocols: SAML, WS-Federation, WS-Trust, SCIM, etc.
		- > Before learning OIDC, under ((6524bbcf-799f-46b3-b599-1f2096bbd1d3))
		- ![OIDC.jpg](../assets/OIDC_1716427897526_0.jpg){:height 578, :width 998}
			- The OpenID Provider interacts with the user to authenticate them (assuming they haven’t logged in already).
			- After authentication, the user’s browser is redirected back to the application.
			- The application can request that claims about the authenticated user be returned in a security token called an **ID Token**.
			- Alternatively, it can request an OAuth 2 access token and use it to call the OpenID Provider’s *UserInfo endpoint* to obtain the claims.
		- ### What is Federated Authentication?
		  background-color:: green
			- Although many applications have their own system of accounts (including usernames and passwords), some applications rely on other services to verify the identity of users. This is called __federated authentication__.
			- In a corporate IT environment, applications may trust on the following to authenticate users
				- an Active Directory server
				- a LDAP server, or
				- a SAML provider
			- On the Web, applications often trust OpenID providers (such as Google or Yahoo!) to handle the authentication of users.
			- eliminates the need for each web application to build its own custom authentication system, and it makes it much easier and faster for users to sign up and sign into sites around the Web.
			- **Comparison to OAuth2**
				- Passing permission to access authentication information (the user’s identity) to a site is very similar to passing along delegated access to a user’s data.
				- OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and is designed as a modular specification.
		- ### How OpenID Flow works?
		  background-color:: green
			- The basic flow for OpenID Connect is:
				- 1. The application requests OAuth 2.0 authorization for one or more of the OpenID Connect scopes (`openid`, `profile`, `email`, `address`) by redirecting the user to an identity provider.
				- 2. After the user approves the OAuth authorization request, the user’s web browser is redirected back to the application using a traditional OAuth flow.
			- The app makes a request to the __Check ID Endpoint__. This endpoint returns the user’s identity (`user_id`) as well as other bits, such as the `aud` and `state`, which must be verified by the client to ensure valid authentication.
			- If the client requires additional profile information about the user, such as the user’s full name, picture, and email address, the client can make requests to the __UserInfo Endpoint__.
		- ### OIDC Terminology
		  background-color:: green
			- #### Roles
			  background-color:: gray
			  collapsed:: true
				- There are three different roles involved in the OIDC solution:
				- **End User** – The end user is a subject to be authenticated. (We will use the term “user” for simplicity and consistency across chapters.)
				- **OpenID Provider (OP)** – The OpenID Provider is an OAuth 2 authorization server that implements OIDC and can authenticate a user and return claims about the authenticated user and the authentication event to a relying party (application).
				- **Relying Party (RP)** – An OAuth 2 client which delegates user authentication to an OpenID Provider and requests claims about the user from the OpenID Provider. We will generally use the term “application” for the relying party.
			- #### ID Token
			  background-color:: gray
				- An ID Token is a security token used by an OpenID Provider to convey claims to an application about an authentication event and authenticated user.
				- JWT
					- The ID token is a __JSON Web Token (JWT)__, which is a digitally signed and/or encrypted representation of the user’s identity asserted by the identity provider. The JWT format is designed to convey claims between two parties.
					- Instead of using cryptographic operations to validate the JSON Web Token, it can be treated as an opaque string and passed to the __Check ID Endpoint__ for interpretation.
					- The OpenID Provider signs the JWT in accordance with the **JSON Web Signature (JWS)** specification.
					- For confidentiality, the OpenID Provider can optionally encrypt the JWT using **JSON Web Encryption (JWE)** after it is signed. If this is done, it produces a nested JWT.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716429713111_0.png){:height 727, :width 1011}
				- This is a separate token from the access token, which is used to retrieve the user’s profile information or other user data requested during the same authorization flow.
				- Google’s OpenID Connect implementation uses the following Endpoints:
					- #### CheckID Endpoint
						- Endpoint - https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo
						- Request
							- ```bash 
							  curl https://accounts.example.com/oauth2/tokeninfo?
							  id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJhY2NvdW50cy5nb29nbGUuY29tIiwiY...
							  ```
						- Response
							- ```json 
							  {
							  "iss" : "https://accounts.example.com",
							  "user_id" : "113487456102835830811",
							  "aud" : "753560681145-2ik2j3snsvbs80ijdi8.apps.googleusercontent.com",
							  "exp" : "1311281970",
							  "nonce" : "53f2495d7b435ac571"
							  }
							  ```
						- If this verification is completed successfully, the `user_id` is known to represent the unique identifier for the authenticated user, within the scope of the issuer (`iss`). If storing the identifier in a user database table and multiple identity providers are supported by your application, it is recommended that both values be stored upon account creation and queried upon each subsequent authentication request.
					- #### UserInfo Endpoint
						- Endpoint - https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo
						- Request
							- ```bash
							  GET /v1/userinfo HTTP/1.1
							  Host: accounts.example.com
							  Authorization: Bearer ya29.AHES6ZSzX
							  ```
						- Response
							- ```json
							  {
							  "user_id": "3191142839810811",
							  "name": "Example User",
							  "given_name": "Example",
							  "family_name": "User",
							  "email": "user@example.com",
							  "verified": true,
							  "profile": "http://profiles.example.com/user",
							  "picture": "https://photos.profiles.example.com/user/photo.jpg",
							  "gender": "female",
							  "birthday": "1982-02-11",
							  "locale": "en-US"
							  }
							  ```
			- #### UserInfo Endpoint
			  background-color:: gray
				- Used when the user profile claims are too large for an ID token returned via a URL fragment or if the claims contain sensitive info.
				- Request
					- ```http
					  GET /userinfo HTTP/1.1
					  Host: authorizationserver.com
					  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
					  ```
				- Response
					- ```http
					  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
					  Content-Type: application/json
					  {
					     "sub": "1234567",
					     "name": "Fred Smith",
					     "given_name": "Fred",
					     "family_name": "Smith",
					     "preferred_username": "fred.smith",
					     "email": "fred.smith@example.com",
					     "email_verified": true,
					     "picture":"https://example.com/fred.smith/fred.smith.jpg",
					    }
					  ```
		- ### Security Properties
		  background-color:: green
			- Replay attacks occur when legitimate credentials are sent multiple times for malicious purposes.
			- There are 2 main types of replay attacks we wish to prevent:
				- (1) An attacker capturing a user’s OAuth credentials as they log in to a site and using them later on the same site.
					- _Solution_: The OAuth 2.0 specification requires the OAuth endpoint and APIs to be accessed over SSL/TLS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, such as the first case.
				- (2) A rogue application developer using the OAuth token a user was issued to log in to their malicious app in order to impersonate the user on a different legitimate app.
					- _Solution_: To solve this, use the Check ID Endpoint to verify that the credentials issued by the OAuth provider were issued to the correct application.
					- It is recommended that all developers use the Check ID Endpoint or decode the JSON Web Token to verify the asserted identity, though this is not strictly necessary in some cases when the application uses the server-side Web Application flow and the UserInfo Endpoint provides all required information.
		- ### OIDC Flows
		  background-color:: green
			- The OIDC flows are designed around the constraints of different types of applications and bear some similarity to the grant types defined in OAuth 2. The original OIDC core specification defines the following flows:
				- Authorization Code Flow
				- Implicit Flow
				- Hybrid Flow
			- | Flow Type | Request Type | Endpoint | Input | Output |
			  | AuthZ code Flow | Authentication request | `GET /authorize` | Client Id, `response_type = code` | AuthZ code |
			  |   | Token request | `POST /token` | `grant_type = authorization_code`, AuthZ code | ID token, Access token, Refresh token, `token_type=Bearer`|
			  | Implicit Flow | Authentication request | `GET /authorize` | Client Id, response_type = `id_token` | ID Token |
			  | Hybrid Flow | Authentication request | `GET /authorize` | Client Id, `response_type = code id_token` | AuthZ code |
		- ### 1. OIDC Flow - AuthZ Code Flow
		  background-color:: green
			- Public client applications that cannot securely maintain a secret for such authentication can use Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)
			- The use of PKCE is designed to mitigate the risk of an authorization code being intercepted by an unauthorized party. Refer ((664e8a63-d4cd-4d8f-a2d6-1cec57b69fd7))
			-
			- ![oidc_authz_flow.jpg](../assets/oidc_authz_flow_1716428619788_0.jpg)
			- Authentication Request
				- ```http
				  GET /authorize?
				  response_type=code
				  & client_id=<client_id>
				  & state=<state_value>
				  & nonce=<nonce_value>

				  & code=<authorization_code>
				  & redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>
				  & code_verifier=<code_verifier>
				  ```
			- Token Response

				       Cache-Control: no-store
				       Pragma: no-cache
				  {
				       "id_token" : <id_token>,
				       "access_token" : <access_token value>,
				       "refresh_token" : <refresh_token value>,
				       "token_type" : "Bearer",
				       "expires_in" : <token lifetime>
				  }
				  ```
		- ### 2. OIDC Flow - Implicit Flow
		  background-color:: green
			- Get ID Token directly without involving any access token
			- By default, the OIDC Implicit Flow returns all tokens via front-channel browser interaction to the redirect URI, using a URL fragment. The use of “id_token token” response_type is not recommended with the default response mode as it would expose an access token to potential compromise through a referer header or the browser’s history.
			-
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716591754755_0.png){:height 492, :width 616}
			- In this flow, ID token is passed as part of the callback URL fragment. e.g., https://myapp.com/callback.com#id_token=xxxxx. Hence public clients must avoid implicit flow and should use the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE instead.

							- A proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers
							- Resources are returned to the client as if they originated from the web server itself
						- PingAccess acts as a combined reverse proxy and policy server, applying access management rules.

	- ## mTLS
	  background-color:: pink
	  collapsed:: true
		- Mutual transport layer security (mTLS) or two-way secure socket layer is a method for mutual authentication.
		- It ensures that traffic is secure and trusted in both directions between a client and the server – it ensures that both parties sharing information are who they claim to be by verifying that they both have the correct private key.
		- In mutual includes an additional step in which the server also asks for the client's certificate and verifies it at their end. It is considered more secure than TLS, but it’s also more computationally costly.
		- ### What is TLS?
		  background-color:: blue
			- [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/) is an encryption protocol in wide use on the Internet. TLS, which was formerly called SSL. It serves 2 purposes
				- authenticates the server in a client-server connection (trust)
				- and encrypts communications between client and server so that external parties cannot spy on the communications. (secure)
			- Netscape Communications Corporation developed SSL in 1994 to secure web sessions.
			- TLS is normally implemented on top of TCP in order to encrypt application layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP and IMAP, although it can also be implemented on UDP, datagram congestion control protocol (DCCP) and stream control transmission protocol (SCTP), as well.
		- ### How TLS works?
		  background-color:: blue
			- There are 3 important things to understand about how TLS works
				- Public key cryptography
				- TLS certificate
					- A TLS certificate is a data file that contains important information for verifying a server's or device's identity, including the public key, a statement of who issued the certificate (TLS certificates are issued by a certificate authority), and the certificate's expiration date.
				- TLS handshake
					- The [TLS handshake](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/) is the process for verifying the TLS certificate and the server's possession of the private key. The TLS handshake also establishes how encryption will take place once the handshake is finished.
			- In TLS, the server has a TLS certificate and a public/private key pair, while the client does not. The typical TLS process works like this:
				- Client connects to server
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Server presents its TLS certificate
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Client verifies the server's certificate
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Client and server exchange information over encrypted TLS connection
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- ![how_tls_works-what_is_mutual_tls.png](../assets/how_tls_works-what_is_mutual_tls_1704644534439_0.png){:height 308, :width 889}
		- ### How mTLS works?
		  background-color:: blue
			- In mTLS, however, both the client and server have a certificate, and both sides authenticate using their public/private key pair.
			- Compared to regular TLS, there are additional steps in mTLS to verify both parties (additional steps in **bold**):
				- Client initiates the handshake with the server
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- The client initiates the handshake with the ‘Client Hello.’ It consists of several pieces of information, including: 
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					  > Version:      Hex code of the highest version of TLS/SSL that the client supports.
					  Session ID:    An 8-byte value, initially all 0s, is used to label the sessions.
					  Cipher Suits:  A list of cipher suites (algorithms) client supports, which is nothing but a set of cryptographic algorithms, like RSA, etc.
				- Server responds with handshake
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Once received, the server responds with ‘Server Hello,’ which consists of the same five pieces of information for the server, this time with a session ID.
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Server sends its TLS certificate along with its certificate chain and its public key
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Client verifies the server's certificate with a certificate authority
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Is the certificate valid? This done by verifying the signature on the certificate using CA’s public key (that it was indeed signed by CA using his private key) 
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Does it belong to the intended server?
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- To verify whether the certificate belongs to the intended server, the client creates a random secret key and encrypts it using the server’s public key and sends it to the server.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- **Client presents its TLS certificate**
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- **Server verifies the client's certificate**
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- **Server grants access**
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Client and server exchange information over encrypted TLS connection
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number

		- ### Difference between TLS and mTLS
		  background-color:: blue
		  collapsed:: true
			- | **TLS** | **mTLS** |
			  | Only server has a TLS certificate and a public/private key pair, while the client does not | Both client and server have their own TLS certificate and a key pair |
			  | TLS uses an external certificate authority | Organization implementing mTLS act as its own certificate authority. It uses a self-signed root certificate -  meaning the org creates it themselves. This won't work for one-way TLS on the public Internet because an external CA has to issue those certificates |
			  | Computationally cheap and fast | Costly and slower due to additional round-trips|
		- ### Where to use mTLS?
		  background-color:: blue
		  collapsed:: true
			- mTLS is often used in zero trust security environments to verify users, devices, and servers within an org network.
			- In B2B API interactions where the server doesn’t want to expose its services to the entire world and wants to make sure the request is coming from a known client.
			- In B2B financial transactions. For example, transactions between two bank servers.
			- For authenticating and encrypting service-to-service communication between microservices or with the API gateway.
		- ### mTLS in Service Mesh
		  background-color:: blue
		  collapsed:: true
			- For implementing mTLS, the service mesh control plane offers:
				- A Certificate Authority that issues trusted x.509 certificates for microservices authentication
				- A configuration API server to define and deliver communication security policies for authentication and authorization to the sidecar proxies.
				- Sidecar proxies that sit alongside each microservice and help manage communications based on security policies
			- ![Service-mesh-control-plane.webp](../assets/Service-mesh-control-plane_1704675286343_0.webp){:height 395, :width 901}
		- ### Pros
		  background-color:: blue
			- Prevents various kinds of attacks including
				- **On-path attacks:** [On-path attackers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/on-path-attack/) place themselves between a client and a server and intercept or modify communications between the two. When mTLS is used, on-path attackers cannot authenticate to either the client or the server, making this attack almost impossible to carry out.
				- **Credential stuffing:** Attackers use leaked sets of credentials from a data breach to try to log in as a legitimate user. Without a legitimately issued TLS certificate, [credential stuffing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/) attacks cannot be successful against organizations that use mTLS.
				- **Phishing attacks:** The goal of a phishing attack is often to steal user credentials, then use those credentials to compromise a network or an application. Even if a user falls for such an attack, the attacker still needs a TLS certificate and a corresponding private key in order to use those credentials.
				- **Malicious API requests:** When used for [API security](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-api-security/), mTLS ensures that API requests come from legitimate, authenticated users only. This stops attackers from sending malicious API requests that aim to exploit a vulnerability or subvert the way the API is supposed to function.
		- ### Cons
		  background-color:: blue
			- Complex to implement
			- Managing of the certificates is painful.
				- The server must create a unique certificate for each client that wants to connect to the service. From the browser/human perspective, this can be a pain, as the user has to do some extra configuration to interact with the server.
			- More computationally costly and slower than TLS
			- Can only be used in an environment where you have control over the clients and can dictate what type of security each client must have in order to connect to the server.
- # 2. Authorization
  background-color:: yellow
  collapsed:: true
	- ## Overview
	  background-color:: pink
		- Authorization is essentially access control - controlling what your users can access in your application, such as resources, web pages, etc.
		- ### Levels of Authorization and Access Policy Enforcement
		  background-color:: green
			- **2 Functions of Authorization**
				- In governing what a user or application can do, there are two distinct functions.
				- **Authorization**
					- We use the term authorization for the granting of privileges. e.g., movie ticket.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716495183703_0.png){:height 350, :width 440}
				- **Access Policy Enforcement**
					- In contrast, access policy enforcement is defined as the act of checking that a person or application has been granted the necessary privilege before responding to a request for a protected resource. e.g., act of verifying the ticket.
					- For example, if you buy a theater ticket, the ticket constitutes your authorization to attend the performance. On the night of the performance, the ticket taker at the door enforces policy by checking to ensure that only authorized patrons (with tickets) enter the theater.
					- Policy Enforcement point can be within the resource server or outside.
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716495236937_0.png){:height 615, :width 893}
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716494905265_0.png){:height 1063, :width 937}
		- ### User authorization vs. Application Authorization
		  background-color:: green
			- A *user* needs authorization to perform various functions within an application.
			- An *application* requires authorization to call a protected API. If the content at a third-party API is owned by the user of the application, the application’s access is on the user’s behalf and requires the user’s authorization.
			- #### User authorization
			  background-color:: gray
				- There are different models available for specifying the user authorization policy
				- **ACL model** (Access Control List)
					- In this scheme, the authorization policy is often specified as a list of entities granted access for a specific protected resource in a file.
					- Each individual file has a list of the users or groups of users who have been granted access to the file. When someone requests access to a file, the policy enforcement point needs to check if the authenticated identity of the requestor is in the list of users in the file’s ACL.
					- Roles/Users assigned with access to certain features. Users are assigned to roles. This model is not flexible since roles cannot be added dynamically
				- **RBAC model** (Role Based Access Control)
					- Roles and their privileges are defined in the authorization policy.
					- e.g., developer role can only read the files, manager role can create and read files, admin role can perform all CRUD operations
				- **ABAC model** (Attribute Based Access Control)
					- authorization is specified via rules that utilize attributes in a user's profile.
					- For example, access to a finance system might be allowed for all users that satisfy the rule “*user_profile:team = finance AND user_profile_location = NYC*”
					- There are 2 types of attributes
						- **User profile attribute**
							- static factors e.g., organization/team, age, department, etc.
						- **Transactional attributes**
							- user's physical environment at the time of authentication or accessing a protected resource
							- e.g., geographical location, user is within or outside the organization network, etc.
			- #### Application Authorization
			  background-color:: gray
				- No standards available in this space
		- ### 3 steps involved in controlling access
		  background-color:: green
			- **Who is allowed access?** Specification of access policy (ACL, RBAC, ABAC, etc.)
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- **How to deliver the allowed entities to the requesting app?** Delivery of authorization info to the enforcement point
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- delivered as claims in ID token (*OIDC*)
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- delivered as claims via `/userinfo` endpoint (*OIDC*)
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- delivered via attribute statements (*SAML2*)
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- delivered as claims in JWT-format access tokens (*OAuth*)
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- **How to enforce access?** Enforcement
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- validate the token signature
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- validate the token is not expired
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- validate the issuer is the correct OpenID provider

	- ## OAuth2
	  background-color:: pink
	  id:: 6524bbcf-799f-46b3-b599-1f2096bbd1d3
		- > OAuth 2.0 = Federated Authorization
		  OpenID Connect = Federated Authentication
		- __What is OAuth?__
			- OAuth is a _delegated authorization_ protocol
			- Delegated authorization is granting access to another person or application to perform actions on your behalf.
			- When you drive your car to a classy hotel, they may offer valet parking. You then authorize the valet attendant to drive your car by handing him the key in order to let him perform actions on your behalf.
			- OAuth works similarly—a user grants access to an application to perform actions on the user'' behalf and the application can only perform the authorized actions.
		- __Benefits of OAuth?__
			- OAuth provides the ability to access a user'' data securely, without handing over the account password.
			- OAuth eliminates data silos
			- Having a common protocol for handling API authorization greatly improves the developer experience.
		- __Why not basic username and password?__
			- user may not trust providing their credentials to your app
			- username-password provides only authn, not authz
			- only way a user can revoke access to your app is by changing the password
			- difficult to implement stronger authentication like CAPTCHAs or multi-factor authn

		- ### OAuth Terminology
		  background-color:: green
		  id:: 6524bbcf-8a2d-44d4-a6fd-fc164e8192fa
		  collapsed:: true
			- __Client__
				- Needs an access token to use a resource (typically an API) on a resource server
				- An application making web or API requests to perform actions on protected resources on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization. e.g., Quora
				- There are 2 types of Client
					- Public Client
					- Confidential Client
			- __Resource server (RS)__
				- The server hosting user-owned resources that are protected by OAuth. This is typically an API provider that holds and protects data such as photos, videos, calendars, or contacts. e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.
				- Location of a protected resource (typically an API that a client is requesting access to)
				- E.g., PingAccess can act as a Resource Server
			- __Resource owner (RO)__
				- Typically the user of an application, the resource owner has the ability to grant access to their own data hosted on the resource server.
				- In many OAuth workflows, a resource on a resource server has an owner. The resource owner must authorize the issuance of an access token.
			- __Authorization server / Token Provider__
				- The authorization server gets consent from the resource owner and issues access tokens to clients for accessing protected resources hosted by a resource server. e.g., Okta, Auth0
				- Smaller API providers may use the same application and URL space for both the authorization server and resource server.
				- A server that issues, validates and maintains tokens for the OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols
				- Allows are resource owner to grant authorization to a client requesting access to resources protected by a resource server
				- Issue access and refresh tokens
				- Maintain scope list
				- Maintain client list
				- Issue authorization codes
				- E.g., PingFederate is a token provider
			- __Access Token__
				- Credentials clients use to access protected resources
				- A string representing an authorization issued to the client
				- Represent specific scopes and duration of access
				- Granted by the resource owner
				- Enforced by the resource server(RS) and the authorization server (AS)
				- **Access Token Security Model**
					- Access tokens use a bearer token security model.
					- A client's presentation of the token to the RS provides sufficient proof that the client received the same token from the OAuth AS
					- A bearer token is like paper money ⏤ whoever holds the token is granted access.
				- **Access Token Data Model**
					- **Reference tokens**:
						- Reference tokens are smaller and act only as a pointer (reference) to the actual token.
						- The RS sends the token to the AS (introspection) to verify validity and determine what level of access to grant (claims).
					- **Self-contained tokens**
						- Self-contained tokens are in JWT format and contain the entire access token.
						- JWT scan be cryptographically signed by the AS, so the RS can perform validation and introspection without having to send the token to the AS
			- __Refresh Token__
				- A special token used to obtain a renewed access token
				- Used for long-lived relationships between a client and resource server
			- __Grant types__
				- 2 grant types: Authorization code and Client Credentials
				-
				- **Authorization code**
					- Proof of user authorization. A user explicitly authorizes an application (web app or native app)
					- Client exchanges an authorization code for an access token. e.g., Client ID
				- **Client Credentials**
					- Used for server to server communication (no user involved)

				- ![download.png](../assets/download_1714734917923_0.png){:height 207, :width 881}
			- __Scopes__
				- Provide a way to limit the amount of access that is granted to an access token
				- Just a string
				- Generally, client specifies desired scopes when asking for authorization
				- Issued access token is associated with these approved scopes in the AS
				- Examples of Github scopes: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps

			- #### Client Registration
			  background-color:: gray
			  collapsed:: true
				- OAuth requires that applications register with the authorization server so that API requests are able to be properly identified. While the protocol allows for registration using automated means, most API providers require manual registration via filling out a form on their developer websites.
				- After registration is complete, the developer is issued client credentials:
					- _Client ID_ - Specified as `client_id` when interacting with the resource server
					- _Client Secret_ - Specified as `client_secret` when exchanging an authorization code for an access token and refreshing access tokens using the server-side Web Application Flow.
				- _Why Register?_
					- Registration enables the application developer to obtain client credentials, which are used to authenticate requests made to the authorization server. These credentials are critical in protecting the authenticity of requests when performing operations such as exchanging authorization codes for access tokens and refreshing access tokens
				- [Google APIs Console](http://code.google.com/apis/console)
				- Microsoft Windows Live [application management site](https://manage.dev.live.com/).
				- [Facebook Developers site](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).
		- ### Tokens & AuthZ code
		  background-color:: green
			- The OAuth 2 Authorization Framework defines different methods by which an application interacts with an authorization server to obtain authorization to call an API. Each method uses a credential to represent the authorization. These credentials are known as **authorization grants** and are used by an application to obtain an access token with which to call an API. The type of authorization grant to use depends on the use case.
			- The following authorization grant types are defined:
				- Authorization code
				- Client credentials
				- Refresh token
			- | **AuthZ grant type** | **Input** | **Output** | 
			  | Authorization Code| AuthZ code| Access Token and optional Refresh Token |
			  | Client Credentials| Username and password| Access Token and optional Refresh Token |
			  | Refresh Token| Refresh Token| Access Token and optional Refresh Token |
			- In the below picture, step 3 uses AuthZ code as grant and step 9 uses Refresh token as grant.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716400789449_0.png)
			- #### Access Tokens
			  background-color:: gray
				- OAuth 2 authorized APIs require only bearer tokens to make authorized requests.
				- _Bearer tokens_ are a type of access token whereby simple possession of the token values provides access to protected resources. No additional information, such as a cryptographic key, is needed to make API calls. This is like a movie ticket - the one who bears the token is allowed entry.
				- The preferred method of authorizing requests is by sending the access token in a HTTP Authorization header
					- ```http
					  GET /tasks/v1/lists/@default/tasks HTTP/1.1 
					  Host: www.googleapis.com
					  Authorization: Bearer ya29.AHES6ZSzX
					  ```
				- **Types of Access Tokens**
					- **Opaque Token**
						- e.g., encoded string
						- Client receives an encoded string which is relayed to Resource server. Before sending the resource, Resource Server validates the token by sending it to the authz server and verify the claims from the token.
						- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716427099800_0.png){:height 394, :width 495}
					- **Transparent Token**
						- e.g., JWT
						- Resource Server can validate the claims in the token without sending to the Resource Server. Hence this is also called a *self-contained token*.
				-
				- Different Tokens for resources owned by different entities
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1716495459971_0.png){:height 920, :width 774}
		- ### OAuth Authorization Flows
		  background-color:: green
			- OAuth2 protocol defines 4 primary "grant types" used for obtaining authorization
				- Authorization Code Grant
				- Client Credentials Grant
				- Device Authorization Grant
				- Refresh Token Gran
			- Every OAuth2 grant type flow has the same goal: _To obtain authorization key/access token, which represents a set of permissions, from the user, and perform something on her behalf._
			- Achieving this goal is a 2-part flow:
				- 1. __Get Access Token__: Acquire the authorization key/access token for the user from the OAuth provider, e.g., Twitter
				- 2. __Use Access Token__: Use the authorization key/access token to perform something by calling a protected API endpoint on behalf of the user, e.g., post a tweet
			-
			- | **Grant Type** | **Resource Owner is** | **Action** | **Endpoint** | 
			  | Authorization Code Grant | Human user | Get authz code | `GET /authorize` |
			  |  |  | Get access token | `POST /token` | 
			  | Client Credentials Grant | Application | Get authz code | `POST /api` | 
			  | Refresh Token Grant | Human user | Get access token | `POST /token` |
			-

				  ```
			-
			- __When to use it?__
				- Long-lived access is required.
				- The OAuth client is a web application server.
				- Accountability for API calls is very important and the OAuth token shouldn't be leaked to the browser, where the user may have access to it.
			- __Security Properties__
				- The Authorization Code flow does not expose the access token to the resource owner’s browser.
				- The exchange process only succeeds if a correct `client_secret` is passed with the request, ensuring confidentiality of the access token as long as client security is maintained.
				- because the access token is never sent through the browser— there is less risk that the access token will be leaked to malicious code through browser history, referer headers, JavaScript, and the like
				- Although there is less chance of the access token leaking because it’s not exposed to the browser, many applications using this flow will store long-lived refresh tokens in the application’s database or key store to enable "offline" access to data. There is additional risk when an application requires long-lived offline access to data, as this creates a single point of compromise for accessing data belonging to many users.
			- __How access is revoked?__
				- Applications are not usually informed when a user revokes access, and the specification does not define any way to implement a notification—the app will simply see an error the next time it attempts to use an access token or refresh the token stored for that user.
				- While users can revoke their access manually, some OAuth 2.0 authorization servers also allow tokens to be revoked programmatically. This enables an application to clean up after itself and remove access it no longer needs if, for instance, the user uninstalls the app. Example:
				- `curl "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke?token=ya29.AHES6ZSzF"`
		- ### 2. OAuth Flow - Client credentials
		  background-color:: green
			- This method is used when the application (client) owns the resources in the Resource Server instead of the users.
			- Imagine a storage API, such as Google Storage or Amazon S3. You want to build a tool using one of these APIs to access the images or documents. The application needs to read and update these resources, but acting on behalf of the app itself rather than on behalf of any individual user. The application can ask the OAuth authorization server for an access token directly, without the involvement of any end user.

		  background-color:: green
		- ### 4. OAuth Flow - Refresh Token Grant
		  background-color:: green
			- When an access token expires, an application could make a new authorization request, but with short-lived access tokens, this could result in frequent consent requests for users which would be cumbersome.
			- OAuth 2 defines an alternative approach that involves another type of token called a **refresh token**. Authorization servers may, at their discretion, return a refresh token along with an access token.
			- If an application receives a refresh token from an authorization server, it can use it to obtain a new access token when a previous access token expires.
			- The use of a refresh token to obtain a new access token does not require user interaction, so an application can use a refresh token to obtain a new access token when the user is offline, which facilitates ongoing API access from native mobile applications.
			- A sample call with a refresh token to an authorization server’s token endpoint to request a new access token is shown in the following sample
				- ```http
				  POST /token HTTP/1.1
				  Host: authorizationserver.com
				  Authorization: Basic <encoded application credentials>
				  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
				  grant_type=refresh_token
				  & refresh_token=<refresh_token>

	- When a client is interacting with a RESTful web service, it is possible for hostile individuals to intercept network packets and read requests and responses if your HTTP connection is not secure.
	- Sensitive data should be protected with cryptographic services like SSL. The Web defines the HTTPS protocol to leverage SSL and encryption.
	- ## Hash Functions (a.k.a Message Digest)
	  background-color:: pink
		- Hash functions are an irreversible, one-way form of cryptography in which data is protected while the original message becomes irrecoverable.
		- Hashing functions take arbitrary-sized data and output a fixed-length, unique hash value for each provided input. It can only be cracked by attempting to enter every input possible.
		- They turn any amount of data into a fixed-length "fingerprint" that cannot be reversed. If the input changes by even a tiny bit, the resulting hash is completely different.
		- File hashes are used to validate that a file is from a verified publisher while password can be hashed and stored within a database as a hashed value to secure entry.
		- __Cryptographic hash functions__
			- regular hash functions used in hash tables are designed to be fast, not secure
			- used for protecting passwords. Safe even if the password file is compromised, but at the same time, allows to verify that a user's password is correct.
			- example: SHA256, SHA512, RipeMD, and WHIRLPOOL
		- `java.security.MessageDigest` class supports MD5 and SHA digests.
		- ### Salt Hashing
		  background-color:: blue
		  collapsed:: true
			- > Source: https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm
			- There are several ways in which even a cryptographic hashed password can also be hacked.
			  collapsed:: true
				- __Dictionary Attacks__
				  collapsed:: true
					- uses a file containing words, phrases, common passwords, and other strings that are likely to be used as a password. Each word in the file is hashed, and its hash is compared to the password hash. If they match, that word is the password.
				- __Brute Force Attacks__
				- __Lookup Tables__
				  collapsed:: true
					- The general idea is to pre-compute the hashes of the passwords in a password dictionary and store them, and their corresponding password, in a lookup table data structure. e.g., https://crackstation.net/
					- extremely effective method for cracking many hashes of the same type very quickly
					  
					  ```bash
					  hash("hello")                    = 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
					  # add a random string called 'salt'
					  hash("hello" + "QxLUF1bgIAdeQX") = 9e209040c863f84a31e719795b2577523954739fe5ed3b58a75cff2127075ed1
					  hash("hello" + "bv5PehSMfV11Cd") = d1d3ec2e6f20fd420d50e2642992841d8338a314b8ea157c9e18477aaef226ab
					  hash("hello" + "YYLmfY6IehjZMQ") = a49670c3c18b9e079b9cfaf51634f563dc8ae3070db2c4a8544305df1b60f007
					  ```
					- Lookup tables work only because each password is hashed the exact same way. If two users have the same password, they'll have the same password hashes. We can prevent these attacks by randomizing each hash, so that when the same password is hashed twice, the hashes are not the same.
					- We can randomize the hashes by appending or prepending a random string, called a ***salt***, to the password before hashing.
					- To check if a password is correct, we need the salt, so it is usually stored in the user account database along with the hash, or as part of the hash string itself.
					- The salt does not need to be secret, but should be generated using Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Generator (CSPRG)
					- DO NOT use the username as the salt
					- DO NOT reused the salt for all users. Use a separate random salt string for every user and every time the password is changed.
					- DO NOT use a short salt. To make it impossible for an attacker to create a lookup table for every possible salt, a good rule of thumb is to use a salt that is the same size as the output of the hash function. For example, the output of SHA256 is 256 bits (32 bytes), so the salt should be at least 32 random bytes.
					- DO NOT use double hashing or wacky combination of hashing functions.
					- **Cons**
						- creates interoperability problems
						- makes the hashes less secure, if the hacker gets hold of the open source code ([Kerckhoffs'' principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle) - _A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge_)
					- If needed, use a 'wacky' function like HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code).
					  
					  ```bash
					  md5(sha1(password))
					  md5(md5(salt) + md5(password))
					  sha1(sha1(password))
					  sha1(str_rot13(password + salt))
					  md5(sha1(md5(md5(password) + sha1(password)) + md5(password)))
					  ```
				- **Key Stretching**
					- Salt ensures attackers can't use specialized attacks to crack passwords using large collection of hashes. Using high-end GPUs and custom hardware it is possible to generate billions of hashes in seconds. To make these attacks less effective, we can use a technique known as *key stretching*.
					- Key stretching is implemented using a special type of CPU-intensive hash function. e.g., PBKDF2, bcrypt
					- Key stretching may make it easier to run a DoS (Denial of Service) attack on your website. It can be eliminated by making the user solve a CAPTCHA.
	- ## Symmetric Cryptography
	  background-color:: pink
		- ![symmetric_cryptography.png](../assets/symmetric_cryptography_1704643378693_0.png)
		- Symmetric cryptography, also known as **secret key cryptography**, uses a single key for [encryption](https://builtin.com/cybersecurity/encryption-mechanisms) and decryption, relying on a cryptographic algorithm to create a single key for both the sender and recipient.
		- Secret key cryptography can be used for both in-transit data and at-rest data but is largely reserved for at-rest data. Because the secret key can become compromised during the transmission.
	- ## Asymmetric Cryptography
	  background-color:: pink
		- Asymmetric encryption, also known as **public key encryption**, uses separate keys for the encryption and decryption processes, with one key remaining private and the other being shared for public use.

	- ## Secure Design Concepts
	  background-color:: pink
	  collapsed:: true
		- **1) Defense in depth (layered protection)**
			- Web app firewall + secure code + secure data store
		- **2) Minimize attack surface**
			- Remove unused resources + code
			- Cleanup commented code
		- **3) Least Privilege**
			- RBAC (role based access control) for both the software and the people who build it
		- **4) Fail-safe or Fail-closed**
			- Always fail back to a known state, preferably an original one
			- Fail-safe = rollback transaction and start again, fail gracefully and log errors.
		- **5) Use existing security controls**
			- Do NOT write your own security controls like encryption, encoding, input sanitization, etc.
		- **6) Never hardcode secrets**
		- **7) Re-authentication for important transaction**
			- To avoid CSRF
			- Step up security
		- **8) Segregation of production data**
		- **9) Threat Modelling**
			- https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-threat-modelling.html
			- Evil Brainstorming - brainstorming session in search of defining all threats that your application system or product will likely face
		- **10) Source code protection**
			- Security through obscurity (obfuscation)
		- **11) Error handling**
			- Never show stacktrace to users. Hackers can learn what tech stack you are using. Always catch your errors.
		- **12) Logging and alerting**
			- Don't log PII data. Log enough for debugging and auditing purposes.

	- ## Security Testing Methodologies
	  background-color:: pink
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### SAST
		  background-color:: blue
		  collapsed:: true
			- **What is SAST?**
				- Static Application Security Testing
				- SAST is open box testing that scans a software application from the inside out before it is compiled or executed.
			- **How it works?**
				- SAST analyzes program source code to identify security vulnerabilities e.g., SQL injection, buffer overflows, XML external entity (XXE) attacks, and other [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) security risks.
				- SAST testing is integrated in the CI/CD pipelines to detect security errors in the earlier stages of development.
			- e.g., Checkmarx
		- ### DAST
		  background-color:: blue
		  collapsed:: true
			- **What is DAST?**
				- Dynamic Application Security Testing
				- DAST is a security testing methodology that involves dynamic analyzing of an application in its running state.
				- It scans software applications in real-time against leading vulnerability sources, like the OWASP Top 10 or SANS/CWE 25, to find security flaws or open vulnerabilities.
			- **How it works?**
				- DAST testing simulates the actions of a malicious actor trying to break into your application from the outside.
				- DAST often works from the outside in, identifying security vulnerabilities by simulating attacks, inspecting HTTP responses and observing the application’s reactions.
			- **Cons**
				- This external approach means it lacks the ability to understand the complex nuances and contexts of the code being run. This, in turn, limits DAST’s effectiveness and accuracy, especially when it comes to modern, complex applications.
				- The existing DAST tools send attacks from an external vantage point and then attempt to determine whether these attacks are successful based on HTTP responses. While effective in certain circumstances, this method doesn’t offer detailed insights about what’s happening inside the code and therefore often misses true vulnerabilities.
			- | **SAST** | **DAST** |
			  | Scans app code at rest | Scans application at runtime | 
			  | open-box testing | closed-box testing |
			  | occurs during the early stages of development | scans a working application post deployment |
			  | CANNOT catch authentication and encryption issues allowing unauthorized access | CAN catch |
			  | Technology dependent | Independent |
		- ### IAST
		  background-color:: blue
		  collapsed:: true
			- **What is IAST?**
				- Interactive Application Security Testing
				- IAST is a form of AppSec testing that analyzes applications in a running state but analyzes them from the inside out, rather than from the outside in.
				- combines the functions of both SAST and DAST - it uses a monitoring mechanism (sensor or agent) in the application’s backend to gather information during runtime.
				- provides highly detailed vulnerability descriptions that include the HTTP request, the exact lines of code involved, and the exact flow of data through an application or an API
			- **How it works?**
				- IAST uses instrumentation to monitor an application’s internal operations, interactions with  libraries, connections with backend systems and more, all in real time while the application is being used.
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1704824876867_0.png)
			- **Pros**
				- IAST-style DAST does not require vulnerabilities to be exploited in order to discover them. Ordinary application traffic, not fuzzing and attack exploits, can be used to find complex vulnerabilities. This opens the world of DAST to anyone, not just experienced AppSec experts. Developers can instantly find vulnerabilities in their code as they do their ordinary quality testing. All quality assurance (QA) testing, including automated test cases, can now do double-duty as both QA testing and security testing at once.
				- allows developers test their application's behaviors at runtime using DAST testing techniques while still monitoring source code execution, like SAST testing. IAST mitigates a significant limitation of the SAST methodology: its inability to follow and test all dependencies, like libraries and frameworks, that modern web applications use
- # Zero Trust
  background-color:: pink
	- ## Overview
		- Perimeter vs. Zero Trust
			- Perimeter model
				- The perimeter model attempts to build a wall between trusted and untrusted resources (i.e., local network and the internet).
			- Zero Trust model
				- basically throws the towel in, and accepts the reality that the “bad guys” are everywhere. Rather than build walls to protect the soft bodies inside, it turns the entire population into a militia.
		- Automation is key to attain Zero Trust.
			- Interactions between the control plane and the data plane are the most critical points requiring automation. If policy enforcement cannot be dynamically updated, zero trust will be unattainable; therefore it is critical that this process be automatic and rapid.
		- 3 key components in a zero trust network:
			- *user/application authentication*,
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *device authentication*,
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- and *trust*.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- a “trust score” is computed, and the application, device, and score are bonded to form an agent. Policy is then applied against the agent in order to authorize the request. The richness of information contained within the agent allows very flexible yet fine-grained access control, which can adapt to varying conditions by including the score component in your policies.

	- ## OReilly Spring Security for REST APIs
	  background-color:: pink
		- [Presentation Slide](/technology/springsecurityforrestapis.pdf)
		- [https://www.katacoda.com/jzheaux/scenarios/local-authentication](https://www.katacoda.com/jzheaux/scenarios/local-authentication)
		- [https://github.com/jzheaux/oreilly-spring-security-rest-apis](https://github.com/jzheaux/oreilly-spring-security-rest-apis)
		- `@SpringBootApplication(exclude = SecurityAutoConfiguration.class)`
		- doing this in a Spring Boot app disables Spring Security. DON'T DO THIS.
		- once the `exclude` is removed, every single url is now protected by Spring Security. Accessing the urls now would throw http 401 unauthorized error.
		- Accessing invalid/non-existent urls also would throw 401 instead of 404 by design. Spring Security uses this approach to avoid hackers from fingerprinting the valid url patterns by trial and error.
		- ### Username-password
		  collapsed:: true
			- Spring Security has a default user (called `user`), but not a default password (by design). However, it generates a new GUID password for every Spring Boot run.
			- `http -a user:0b44ffc6-db54-4220-8b0d-27f55806c602 :8080/goals`
			- Example of using a custom username-password hardcoded in the code. Spring supports JDBC, LDAP also.
			  
			  ```java
			  import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
			  
			  import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails;
			  import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetailsService;
			  import org.springframework.security.provisioning.InMemoryUserDetailsManager;
			  
			  @Configuration
			  public class SecurityConfig{
			  @Bean
			  public UserDetailsService userDetailsService(){
			  return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(
			    User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
			      .username("user")
			      .password("pwd")
			      .authorities("app")
			      .build()
			  );
			  }
			  }
			  ```
		- ### Authentication
			- Spring Security is a set of servlet filters chained together. e.g., Authentication filter, authorization filter, defense filter (`HeaderWriterFilter`)
			  
			  | ![](../assets/spring-security-filter-chain.png) | ![](../assets/spring-security-filter-order.png) |
			  | ![](../assets/spring-security-basic-auth-filter.png) | |
			- Once the user is authenticated successfully, from anywhere in the app one can get the authenticated principal details (e.g., username) using the `SecurityContextHolder` as follows. Another way is to ask Spring to inject it for you.
			  
			  ```java Get authenticated user name - Method 1
			  Authentication auth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
			  String username = auth.getName();
			  ```
			  
			  ```java Get authenticated user name - Method 2
			  @GetMapping("/")
			  public String myMethod(Authentication auth){
			  	String username = auth.getName();
			  }
			  ```
			  
			  ```java Get authenticated user name - Method 3
			  @GetMapping("/")
			  public String myMethod(@AuthenticationPrincipal String owner) {
			  }
			  ```
			  
			  ```java Get authenticated user name - Method 4
			  @GetMapping("/")
			  public String myMethod(@CurrentSecurityContext(expression="authentication.name") String owner) {
			  }
			  ```
		- ### CORS
			- When a web app running on an origin (say, http://localhost:8081) tries to connect to a web service hosted on a different origin (say http://localhost:8080), then the browser blocks the call by default throwing a CORS error.
			- To whitelist certain origins to make the call, do as follows:
			  
			  ```java
			  @Configuration
			  public class SecurityConfig{
			    @Bean
			    WebMvcConfigurer webMvc(){
			      return new WebMvcConfigurer{
			        @Override
			        public void addCorsMapping(CorsRegistry registry){
			          registry.addMapping("/**/goals")
			                  .allowedOrigins("http://localhost:8081")
			                  .allowedMethods("GET", "POST")
			                  .allowedHeaders("Content-Type")
			                  .allowCredentials(true) // to allow browser to pass the credentials entered to be passed to the webservice
			                  .maxAge(0); // to disable browser from caching these mappings
			        }
			      };
			    }
			  }
			  ```
			- __Pre-flight request__: A browser sends an `OPTION` request to the server before the actual user request asking _what kind of requests are you ok with me sending, e.g., the origins, http methods, etc._
			- When authentication is enabled in an app, all requests are expected to be authentication including the pre-flight `OPTION` requests. This means the pre-flight requests will fail with 401 error. To avoid this, customize the SecurityFilterChain as follows:
			  
			  ```java
			  @Configuration
			  public class SecurityConfig{
			  @Bean
			  SecurityFilterChain web(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception{
			  return http
			        .authorizeRequests((authz) -> authz.anyRequest().authenticated()) // configuring authorization filter
			        .httpBasic(Customizer.withDefaults())
			        .csrf(Customizer.withDefaults)
			        .cors(Customizer.withDefaults()) // here we are suggesting Spring Security to put this CORS filter with our custom settings in the right place, so that the CORS pre-flight calls are not authenticated.
			        .build();
			  }
			  }
			  ```
		- ### CSRF tokens
			- Spring security performs CSRF checks before authentication for any non-GET HTTP calls with side-effect (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). This is to protect the app from cross site forgery even before the app tries to authenticate the request.
			- Since CSRF checks happens earlier than authentication, the app would throw HTTP 403 instead of 401.
			  
			  ```java
			  import org.springframework.security.web.csrf.CsrfToken;
			  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
			  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ModelAttribute;
			  
			  @ControllerAdvice
			  public class CsrfHeaderAdvice {
			    @ModelAttribute("csrf")
			    public CsrfToken token(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
			      CsrfToken token = (CsrfToken) request.getAttribute(CsrfToken.class.getName());
			      if (token != null) {
			        response.setHeader(token.getHeaderName(), token.getToken());
			      }
			      return token;
			    }
			  }
			  ```
