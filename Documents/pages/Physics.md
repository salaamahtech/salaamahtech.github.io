# Classical vs. Modern Physics
collapsed:: true
	- ## Classical physics
	  collapsed:: true
		- Laws and principles of physics that were developed before about 1900 are considered “classical” physics.
		- Classical physics is the physics of everyday objects—tennis balls and squeaky toys, stoves and ice cubes, magnets and electrical wiring. Classical laws of motion govern the motion of anything large enough to see with the naked eye. Classical thermodynamics explains the physics of heating and cooling objects, and the operation of engines and refrigerators. Classical electromagnetism explains the behavior of lightbulbs, radios, and magnets.
	- ## Modern Physics
	  collapsed:: true
		- Modern physics describes the stranger world that we see when we go beyond the everyday. This world was first revealed in experiments done in the late 1800s and early 1900s, which cannot be explained with classical laws of physics. New fields with different rules needed to be developed.
		- Modern physics is divided into two parts, each representing a radical departure from classical rules. One part, relativity, deals with objects that move very fast, or are in the presence of strong gravitational forces. Albert Einstein introduced relativity in 1905, and it’s a fascinating subject in its own right, but beyond the scope of this book.
		- The other part of modern physics is what I talk to my dog about.
		- ### Quantum physics or quantum mechanics
			- is the name given to the part of modern physics dealing with light and things that are very small—molecules, single atoms, subatomic particles. Max Planck coined the word “quantum” in 1900, and Einstein won the Nobel Prize for presenting the first quantum theory of light. The full theory of quantum mechanics was developed over the next thirty years or so.
			- The people who made the theory, from early pioneers like Planck and Niels Bohr, who made the first quantum model of the hydrogen atom, to later visionaries like Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger, who each independently worked out what we now call **quantum electrodynamics* (QED), are rightly regarded as titans of physics. Some elements of quantum theory have even escaped the realm of physics and captured the popular imagination, like Werner Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, Erwin Schrödinger’s cat paradox, and the parallel universes of Hugh Everett’s many-worlds interpretation.
			- Without an understanding of the quantum nature of the electron, it would be impossible to make the semiconductor chips that run our computers. Without an understanding of the quantum nature of light and atoms, it would be impossible to make the lasers we use to send messages over fiber-optic communication lines.
			- The terms “**quantum physics**,” “**quantum theory**,” and “**quantum mechanics**” are more or less interchangeable.
			- Material particles have wave nature and can diffract around objects. If you send a beam of electrons at a barrier, they’ll go around it to the left and to the right, at the same time.
			- **Particle-wave duality** - the fact that both light and matter have particle-like and wavelike properties at the same time. A beam of light, which is generally thought of as a wave, turns out to behave like a stream of particles in some experiments. At the same time, a beam of electrons, which is generally thought of as a stream of particles, turns out to behave like a wave in some experiments. Particle and wave properties seem to be contradictory, and yet everything in the universe somehow manages to be both a particle and a wave. The discovery in the early 1900s that light behaves like a particle is the launching point for all of quantum mechanics
			- Light waves travel only in straight lines, while sound waves seem to bend around obstacles.
- # Cosmos
  collapsed:: true
	- Sound waves cannot travel through vacuum. They need matter - whereas light doesn't need matter.
	- **Wavelength**
		- Wavelength (\lambda) of sound is much higher than light.
		- Wavelength of light determines the color we see.
		- When light travels through air/space, all its color move at the same speed. But when it hits glass at an angle, it slows down and changes direction. Inside the prism, each color moves at a different speed.
			- Violet color - short wavelength, high energy (ultra)
			- Red color - longer wavelength, lowest energy (infra)
		- **Types of light**
			- Gamma ray light
			- Microwave light
			- Infrared light
			- Xray light
			- Radio light
			- Visible light
			- > Many more lights that our eyes CANNOT SEE. They vary in wavelength.
	- **Fraunhoffer lines**
		- Every atom emit a different spectrum of light with some dark color gaps. e.g., H, Na, Fe. That's how astronomers are able to tell what the remote stars are made up of.

- # Quantum
  collapsed:: true
	- Orbit of an electron ($e^-$) has nothing to do with gravity. Its a force of electrical attraction.
	- Greater the size of the orbit of electron in an atom, greater the energy. It has to lose energy to jump down to a lower orbit and vice versa.
	- **Quantum Leaps**
		- Every upward leap is caused by an atom absorbing light.
		- We have no idea what causes the downward leaps – but such leaps always produces light waves – color of which is determined by the energy.

- # Misc
	- **Triple point**
		- Triple point of water at 32F. Boiling point of water and other substances drop in mountains due to less pressure. Takes long to cook
	- **Dry ice 🧊**
		- Water level stays same in a cup of water when ice melts cos ice is less denser than water
	- **Size of earth**
		- Distance between the highest point on earth (Everest - 5.5 miles high) and the lowest point on earth (Mariana trench - 6 miles deep) is around 11-12 miles. Earth’s diameter is around 8000 miles. If a cosmic giant were to rub his fingers on earth’s surface it’d be smoother than a cue ball. 🤯
