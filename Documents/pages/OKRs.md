## About OKR
	- OKR is an alignment tool. But alignment can only happen when teams have structured conversations with each other to set priorities and solve interdependencies.
	- OKR is a management tool, not an employee evaluation tool.
	- OKR helps teams and organizations define shared success criteria.
	- OKRs should determine whether a person or a team achieved success.
	- Don't turn your OKRs into a task list.
	- When setting your OKRs, try to evaluate:
		- Do you measure your effort or results?
		- Are your OKRs focused on your objective or on the means to get there?
	- 1 or more teams can share the same OKRs, but each team can have different initiatives.
	- Frequently set, tracked and re-evaluated - usually quarterly
	- What will you achieve and how you are going to achieve
	- > A goal without a success metric is just a desire
- ## OKR Format
	- > I will <objective> as measured by <key results>
	- __Objectives__
		- Objectives should be simple,short and easy to memorize.
		- memorable, inspirational,engaging,motivate and challenge.
		- Objectives are ambitious and should feel somewhat uncomfortable.
		- Objectives shouldn't be boring. They can fit the organizational culture and be informal and fun. You can use slangs, internal jokes and even profanity - watever fits your culture.
		- Objectives may rollover from one quarter to the next. e.g., such as "Delight our Customers"
	- __Key results__
		- Set of metrics to measure progress.
		- Each objective should have 2-5 KRs.
		- KRs must be quantitative and measurable.
		- Key Results can be the same overtime, just changing the targets.
	- __Types of Key Results__
		- Activity-based KRs
			- Measure the completion of tasks and activities or the delivery of project milestones or deliverables.
			- They usually start with verbs such as launch, create, develop, deliver, build, make, implement, define, release, test, prepare and plan.
			- e.g. Release beta version of the product, Launch a monetizing tab, Create a new training program.
		- Value-based KRs
			- Measure the delivery of value to the organization or its customers. Measure the outcomes of successful activities.
			- Typical structures
				- _Increase/reduce ABC-metric from X to Y_
				- _Maintain ABC-metric in x (When we want to sustain one metric)._
				- _Reach Y on ABC-metric (When we are doing something new)._
			- Examples
				- _Improve net promoter score from X to Y_
				- _Improve average weekly visits per active user from X to Y_
				- _Improve engagement (users that complete a full profile) from X to Y_
				- _Reduce infrastructure costs from X to Y,_
				- _Maintain availability during migration in 99.99%_
- ## Types of OKRs
	- **Strategic OKRs** - longer term (annual), company or big department level
	- **Tactical OKRs** - Shorter term (quarterly), team level with a mid-quarter review
		- you need time to develop initiatives, measure their impact and iterate
		- when creating their tactical OKRs each team has to answer two questions:
			- How can we contribute to the strategic OKRs?
			- Which of the key results included in the strategic OKRs may we impact?
	- OKRs cannot be based on activities for three main reasons:
		- 1) We want a results-focused culture, and not one focused on tasks.
		- 2) If you did all your tasks and nothing improved, that is not success.
			- Success is improving something: Customers are more satisfied, sales are higher, costs have been reduced.
		- 3) Your action plan is just a series of hypotheses
			- The lean startup methodology taught us that an idea is just a non-validated hypothesis.
			- when setting OKRs, focus on the destination, not on the means to get there.
- ## OKRI (Objective, Key Results, Initiatives)
	- Objectives: What we want to achieve.
	- Key Results: How are we going to measure our progress?
	- Initiatives: What are we going to do to reach our OKR: projects, tasks or activities.
		- Initiatives are just bets and have to change if the numbers aren't improving.
		- Instead of tracking the delivery of a project, we should measure the indicators that motivated it in the first place.
- ## Moonshots vs. Roofshots
	- __Moonshots__
		- Moonshots are 'Stretch goals'
		- Just beyond the threshold of what seems possible
		- Success means achieving 60-70%
		- _Cons_
			- Can demotivate people if they can only 60% every time.
			- Lack of accountability and commitment (hey, it's just a stretch goal)
		- _Best practices_
	- Have one Moonshot KR per objective and others as roofshots
	- __Roofshots__
		- Goals that are hard but achievable
		- Success means achieving 100%
		- OKR cadences
		- 1st OKR period: Apr 1 to Jun 1
		- 1st OKR review: May 15
		- Weekly check-ins must happen - even during scrum (OKRs shouldn't turn into New Year resolutions)
