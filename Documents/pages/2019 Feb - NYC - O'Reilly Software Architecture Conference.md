	- ## META: Microservice-based Enterprise Transformation Approach
	- Barriers to Digital Transformation
		- Highly-integrated apps and data
		- Legacy tech, packaged solutions, skill gaps
		- Large, hierarchical organizations
		- Outsourcing, geographical distribution
		- industry regulations, shareholder/public scrutiny
	- Essential vs. accidental complexity
		- Essential - stuff that can't be broken down. the complexity of the software's functional scope and the problems it solves (e.g., correlating and analyzing large amounts of data in real time)
		- accidental - complexity of language implementation
		- Frederick Brook - Mythical man month - No silver bullet article
	- Modularization
		- Modularity is to a technological economy what the division of labor is for the manufactoring
		- Aligned modularization with domains (DDD)
	- Agile
	- System control
		- Roy Fieldings quote on control and REST
	- Beyond system
		- the biggest cause of failure in software-intensive systems is not technical failure; it's building the wrong thing. (Mary Poppendieck - creator of Lean Software Development)
		- almost always
	- Lessons
		- 1 - differentiate the complexity
		- 2 - modularize the system
		- 3 - start small and iterate
		- 4 - influence - don't control - the system
		- 5 - the system is more then 'The System' (people, etc)

		- ### Program Design
		  collapsed:: true
			- ...
		- ### System Design
		  collapsed:: true
			- Define the target system scope
				- Determine functional domains
			- bounded contexts, services, and interactions
				- Determine non-functional domains
			- trust domains (security), operational domains (availability, reliability, capacity)
				- __Complexity in a microservice architecture__
					- Essential complexity in microservices
					- in a microservice architecture, the topology of the implemented system closely resembles the model of the system's essence
					- Accidental complexity in microservices
					- in a microservice architecture, accidental complexity can be minimized through automation and distribution
					  DDD provides a framework for defining and modeling the essentail capabilities of complex software systems.
					- Event Storming - by Alberto Brandolini
					- product, technology teams together - discuss business events and outcomes - sticky notes
					- Innovative dilemma book - 'jobs-to-be-done' process
					- Susan Fowler - __Production Ready Microservices__ book
		- ### Service Design
		  collapsed:: true
			- Sketch the service
				- take an 'outside in' approach
			- Design the _interface_
				- API contract
				- prototype it
				- Design canvas based on Lean Canvas concept
					- the idea here is to put all the information about the service in a single page before jumpting into the implementation
			- Determine the _implementation_
				- Find a reusable service
				- evolve an existing service
				- develop net new service
			- 'Just enough' design
		- ### Foundation Design
		  collapsed:: true
			- think of the capabilities you need, before choosing a technology
			- POISED: technological capability foundation
				- Microservices (honeycomb)
					- platform capabilities
					- observation capabilities
					- interop capabilities
					- security capabilities
					- engineering capabilities
					- deployment capabilities
		- ### Process Design
			- Processes & Methodologies
			- Organizational Practices
			- Cultural Practices
			- Agile - Spotify (idea of guilds)
	- ## Architectural anti-patterns when delivering a software ecosystem with Kubernetes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Anti-patterns
			- Statefulness
			- Keep configurations as environment variables
			- Health check/probes
				- liveness probe - if K8S finds a pod is not passing liveness, it will restart
				- readiness probe - if K8S finds a pod is not passing readiness, it will not restart. It will stop the traffic to that service.
				- Liveness and readiness health checks should be different urls
				- use different port for app and management
			- one pod - multiple containers within.
				- this is nothing but a modular monolith. You cannot deploy or scale independently

	- Serverless Content Delivery
	  collapsed:: true
		- [SymphoniaCloud](https://github.com/SymphoniaCloud)
		- https://github.com/symphoniacloud/sacon-nyc-2019-continuous-delivery
		- Serverless attributes
			- no managing of hosts or processes
			- self auto scaling and provisioning
			- costs based on precise usage
		- Serverless = FaaS + BaaS
			- Function aaS (AWS Lambda, Auth0 Webtask, Google Cloud Functions)
			- Backend aaS (AuthO, Firebase, CloudFront, S3, Parse)
		- S3
			- 99.9999999999% durability
			- 99.99% availability
			- hosting a website on S3
			- pay by the request
			- no servers (from our perspective)
			- highly available
			- highly scalable
			- Caveats
				- relatively slow
				- S3 is regional , so requests must go to the regional data center
				- custom domain require a specific bucket name
					- S3 global bucket namespace == squatting, requires support intervention
				- S3 transfer/request pricing
		- CloudFormation + AWS Route 53 DNS + ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) + Lambda@Edge basics
		- Lambda@Edge basics
			- a flavor of lambda that runs in cloudfront
			- hooks into viewer and origin request/response events
			- Node.js runtime only
			- viewer requests/response has limited capability (5 secs runtime, 10MB response, 1 MB function)
			- origin requests/response (30 secs runtime)
	- Gitops
	- Fitness function driven development
	- Security Principles
	  collapsed:: true
		- Least privilege - limit privileges to the minimum for the context
		- Separate responsibilities - separate and compartmentalize responsibilities and privileges
		- Trust cautiously - assume unknown entities are untrusted, have a clear process to establish trust, validate who is connecting
		- Simplest solution possible - actively design for simplicity - avoid complex failure modes, implicit behavior, unnecessary features
		- Audit sensitive events - record all security significant events in a tamper-resistent store
		- Secure defaults & Fail securely - force changes to security sensitive parameters. Think through failures - to be secure but recoverable
		- Never ruly on obscurity - assume attacker with perfect knowledge, this forces secure system design
		- Defence in depth - don't rely on single point of security, secure every level, stop failures at one level propagating
			- Hardening - Highly secure linux hosts
		- Never invent security tech - don't create  your own security technology - always use a proven component
			- Use tools like Hashicorp Vault
		- Secure the weakest link - find the weakest link in the security chain and strengthen it - repeat! (Threat modelling)
		- Hackers need to get lucky only once. You need to be lucky all the time.

		- In addition to performance questions in interviews, ask security questions too.
		- Threat Modelling
			- around for a long time - predates Agile
			- threat model every story
				- if the story generates a security 'notable event', either fix it or pop it up as a 'threat model candidate finding' for the curator to take notice of
			- "Teach principles not formulas" - Richard Feynman

	- Keynotes
		- Book list
		- Observability
		- Interops
		- Codifying best practices - Archunit
		- Kubernetes Operators - extension points
	- Choreographing Microservices (Allen Holub @allenholub holub.com)
		- Small
		- Independently deployable - one service change should not force other services to change. this includes the UI
		- hides implementation details
		- modeled around business concepts ( DDD is necessary)
		- decentralized ( distributed)
		- highly observable
		- autonomous, highly isolated
			- Microsoft Service Fabric is an abomination - now you are dependent on a platform. Same thing with OpenShift vs Mulesoft
		- temporal isolation
		- location transparency - you don't know where it is running. sticky routing
		- Think 'object' - an object is defined by what it does, not what it contains. Services should be doing something, not providing data.
		- You shouldn't know who's talking to you - you shouldn't need to know the IP address, location, etc. Decoupling.
		- you should be able to radically change the implementation of a class without impacting the clients
		- Bounded context - models business structure or flow.
			- sometimes each bounded context is a microservice, sometimes not
			- context is a runtime boundary
			- no generalized classes shared across contexts
		- UI layer - MVC is a lie.
		- Inter-service communication
			- no RPC. Local != Remote
			- REST - they do only one thing. they manipulate data: GET, PUT
		- Orchestration
			- one central thing orchestrates the entire system
			- synchronous services - one central service orchestrates the workflow with 3 other services. If one goes, down, then
			  *
				- Circuit breaker
				- ???
			- When there's failure (none of the options below work)
				- (1) Saga pattern doesn't work either
				- (2) REtry again
				- (3) Multi-phase commit
				- (4) after-the-fact repair
		- Choreography
			- Choreographed systems are always asynchronous (REST is a synchronous protocol)
			- Orchestration should not be used at all for microservices
			- Reactivity reduces latency
