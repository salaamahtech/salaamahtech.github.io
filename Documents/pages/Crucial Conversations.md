- **Refocus on your motives** - When someone completely disagrees with you on a hot issue, instead of losing temper, start by examining your motives. Ask yourself what you really want.
	- Do not vehemently defend yourself, save face, avoid embarrassment, win, be right or punish others
	- Our motives change when adrenaline kicks in
- **Start with your heart** - although we are merely bystanders in lifeâ€™s never ending stream of head on collisions, rarely are we completely innocent.
	- Work on yourself first - not only can you improve yourself, you are the only person you can change.
- When people contribute to a shared pool, they are committed to act.
- Salute and stay mute - with superiors
- Freeze your lover - with spouse. Giving cold shoulder
