# Topics to cover

* Java
  * GC - serial, parallel, CMS, G1
  * Reference Types - soft, weak, phantom
* Collections
  * Covariance, invariance, contravariance
  * Latest concurrent collections uses techniques like: *copy-on-write, compare-and-swap, Lock interface*
  * Iterators: *Fail-fast & Fail-safe (snapshot & weakly consistent)*
  * Map:
    * general maps use equals(or hashCode)
    * IdentityHashMap use identity
    * SortedMap (TreeMap & ConcurrentSkipListMap) use Comparable or Comparator
  * Comparable vs. Comparator
* Concurrency
  * Atomicity (check-then-act, read-modify-write), 64-bit read/write is not atomic
  * Visibility (synchronized & volatile force to cross memory barrier)
  * Synchronization models (mutex, read-write locks, condition, semaphore)
  * Monitor (No shared object, No Lock)
  * Volatile (cross memory barrier, prevent reordering, guarantee atomic 64-bit read/writes, arrays)
  * Problems (race condition, lock-ordering deadlock, thread starvation deadlock, starvation, livelocks)
  * Future, Timer, TimerTask, ScheduledThreadPool
  * Synchronizers (FutureTask, Semaphore, Latches, CyclicBarrier, Exchanger)
  * Fork-Join pool (work-stealing)
* Database
* PK, FK, PK & Unique key diff
* Cursors (implicit, explicit, forward, refcursor data type, static, dynamic)
* Joins (full outer join, exception join)
* Join Algos
  * nested loop join - when one table is small and other is large with an index on joined columns
  * merge join or sort-merge join - when both tables are large. Faster when data being joined is already sorted by an index
  * hash join - when table is large but data needed is small.
* Normalization
* Indexes - types, properties (visibility, usability, unique/non-unique, composite)
* Views - horizontal, vertical, indexed
*   MDC table
* Design Patterns - adapter, builder, chain of responsibility, command, decorator, facade, factory, mediator, observer, singleton, strategy, template, visitor
* SOA
* Safe operations, Idempotent operations, post-once-exactly-pattern, request-response, request-acknowledge-poll, request-acknowledge-callback, routing expressions, reduce load by service interceptor or reverse proxies
* REST
  * Principles - addressable resources, uniform & constrained interface, representation-oriented, stateless communication, hateoas
  * async request - client-side api future & callback, server-side api AsyncResponse
  * exception mappers, jaxb, security, versioning
  * scalability - browser & proxy caches, http caching(expires, cache-control), revalidation(last-modified, etag)
* JMS - MEPs
* Spring
* Core - Autowiring, profiles
* JDBC - JdbcTemplate, RowMapper, RowCallback
* MVC - lifecycle
* Transaction -
* acid, base,
* txn models(local, programmatic, declarative)
* txn types (flat, with save point, chained, nested, distributed, long-lived)
* 4 isolation levels (read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read, serializable, snapshot)
* read phenomena - dirty read, non-repeatable read, phantom read
* 2PC protocol, heuristic exceptions
* Concurrency control - 2-Phase Locking, MVCC, Optimistic Concurrency Control,
* Distributed computing - CAP, strong vs weak consistency
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Arrays & Strings
* Tree - Traversals, BST, 2-3 tree, Red-Black Tree
* Queue - Queue using stack(s)
